<p>The emblem for the IMRS is shown here, in the top-right corner of the website. It depicts the planet Mars with 12 flags around it.</p>

<p>10 of these flags represent the proposed partnership comprised of the world&rsquo;s top 10 space-faring nations (considering Europe as a single nation for the purpose of this exercise). This includes the 5 nations who created the ISS (USA, Russia, Europe, Canada and Japan), plus 5 new partners (India, China, South Korea, Iran and Brazil). All of these nations will have human spaceflight capability by 2020, and all of them will be able to participate in the IMRS program and send their own astronauts to Mars.</p>

<p>The flag at the top of the emblem is the red-green-blue <em>tricoleur</em>, which is the generally accepted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Mars" target="_blank">flag of Mars</a>. This flag flies atop FMARS. It was designed by Pascal Lee in 1999 and, like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_trilogy" target="_blank"><em>Red Mars</em>, <em>Green Mars</em>, <em>Blue Mars</em> trilogy</a> by Kim Stanley Robinson, is inspired by the colours of a changing Mars. Mars is currently red, due to the ubiquitous presence of iron oxide across its surface. As terraforming proceeds, plants will grow on Mars, causing it to become green. And, eventually, when enough liquid water flows on the surface to form lakes and seas, and the atmosphere has become oxygen, it will be blue like Earth.</p>

<p>The presence of the Mars flag in the emblem is intended to symbolise that we are not merely visiting Mars - this is not a &ldquo;flags and footprints&rdquo; type of exercise - but we are going to Mars to establish a new branch of human civilisation. This symbolism imbues the project with a much grander purpose that will help to inspire participants and supporters.</p>

<p>The flag at the bottom of the emblem is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_flag" target="_blank">flag of Earth</a>. It features the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blue_Marble" target="_blank">Blue Marble</a>, a famous photograph of Earth taken by the crew of Apollo 17. Its role in the emblem is to symbolise that we go to Mars, not as a single nation or even a group of nations, but as &ldquo;the people of Earth&rdquo;, unified, for the benefit of all. To paraphrase the Apollo 11 plaque: &ldquo;We came in peace for all humanity&rdquo;.</p>
