<p>To highlight the advantage of the base-first strategy, as well as landing crews in capsules rather than in habitats, consider how much the MARS program would have cost if a new habitat was constructed and delivered to a different site for every single mission. Once the IMRS has been built, numerous missions and considerable research can be conducted to the same location at comparatively low cost.</p>

<p>The DRA is designed as a precursor to settlement in the sense that it will provide data and knowledge to assist with settlement; however, the material assets delivered to Mars during the DRA missions are not included as part of an overall vision for establishing PHP-M. It proposes three identical or very similar missions to different locations on Mars.</p>

<p>In Blue Dragon, the assets delivered to Mars during the missions (of which there will be at least three and hopefully many more) form the seed of a settlement. Components are intended and designed to last for as long as possible, and be re-used across multiple missions.</p>

<p>This strategy enables infrastructure to be accumulated at that location, which each successive mission will benefit from. Roads will be built. Transponders will be installed around the base to provide an accurate LPS (Local Positioning System) for use by vehicles and robots. Habitats, greenhouses, rovers, power plants and other base components may be re-used, improved, developed, expanded, and integrated with each other and the surrounding landscape until the base can be permanently inhabited. Structures may be built from regolith, or by tunnelling underground or into the side of a hill. A communications, observation and navigation satellite will be positioned above the base in an areosynchronous orbit.</p>

<p>It is therefore crucial that an especially good location be selected, as will be discussed.</p>

<p>A build-up of power-production resources in one location is of particular importance, and serves to demonstrate the real advantage of this approach. Energy is critical for heating, lighting, communications, computing, ECLSS, ISRU and more. Instead of sending, say, shipments of solar cells and batteries to three different locations on the planet, money can be saved by sending two shipments to the same location and thereby providing a reliable abundance of power at that location. The result is significantly improved energy security <em>and</em> reduced cost. With each mission, more hardware can be sent to the IMRS until a very reliable, robust and abundant energy subsystem is installed at the location. This is crucial for long-term survival on Mars, and the same rationale applies to subsystems for water, food, air, propellant, surface mobility, etc.</p>

<p>By sending hardware to three separate locations on Mars, perhaps we would learn more about Mars in the short term. However, each mission would be almost equally risky and costly, and subsequent missions would be less likely. By sending hardware to one location, however, multiple redundant backups of key components (habitats, greenhouses, rovers, power plants, etc.) can be emplaced, thus reducing risk with each successive mission. PHP-M can be established much quicker, and missions can be conducted from the settlement to anywhere on Mars. The long-term result will be that more of Mars is explored and a new world will be opened up for human habitation. This goal is essential for the long-term success of our species and Mars is our best option for achieving this.</p>
