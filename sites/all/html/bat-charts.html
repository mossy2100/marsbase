<p>The following schedule depicts a proposed first human mission. The crew are sent in 2033, which is when Earth and Mars are at closest approach in their 15-16 year synodic cycle. Choosing this particular launch opportunity to send the crew means that they will spend the minimum amount of time in space, which is best for their health and safety. Future crews will not have this advantage, as the distance between Earth and Mars at closest approach will gradually increase for about 8 years (after which it will decrease for about another 8 years until the next minimum), however, we will have more experience when sending these crews, which will compensate. For the first human mission it will be wise to minimise risk as much as we possibly can.</p>

<p>In addition, basing the schedule around the 2033 launch opportunity gives us about the right amount of time necessary to develop the technological elements and the international partnership.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Phase 1: Prepare (now-2030)</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Improve TRL of the Red Dragon EDL system, BioSuits and other hardware elements.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select location for the IMRS.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select and train Alpha Crew.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Develop and construct <em>Athena</em>, the Surface Hab, Transit Hab, Rover, commsats and other major hardware components.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Green Dragon mission to test ISRU technology. Gold Dragon mission to test the Mars Ascent Vehicle.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Phase 2: Predeployment (2031)</h2>

<p>If out intention is to send the crew in 2033, naturally the predeployment phase must occur at the launch opportunity prior, i.e. 2031.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Pack and launch Cargo Dragons, send to the IMRS.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lauch the the L5 Commsat and place in heliocentric orbit at Earth L5.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Launch MCOS and place in areosynchronous orbit above IMRS.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Launch the Rover, land it safely at IMRS, remotely activate and test.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Launch <em>Athena</em>, land it safely at IMRS, remotely activate and test.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Launch the Surface Hab, land it safely at IMRS, remotely activate and test.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use the Rover to explore the surrounding terrain and find a suitable LZ for <em>Pern-1</em></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Phase 3: Construct MTV (2032)</h2>

<p>Although the MTV construction phase is scheduled here for 2032, it could in fact be done at almost any time before the 2033 launch. For the sake of this exercise it can be assumed, for now, that the MTV is constructed in the 2-year period between the predeployment and crew outbound phases. Although this will constrain the amount of time available for training missions and fine-tuning the vehicle, it will ensure the hardware is new at the time of launch.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Launch Transit Hab, full fuel tanks and rocket engines to Earth orbit and assemble into <em>Adeona</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Run fit-out and training missions to&nbsp;<em>Adeona</em>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Phase 4: Crew Outbound (2033)</h2>

  <figcaption>Bat chart - Crew outbound</figcaption>
</figure>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Launch crew in <em>Pern-1</em> by Falcon 9. Perform EOR (Earth Orbit Rendezvous) and dock with <em>Adeona</em>. <em>Pern-1</em> remains docked to <em>Adeona</em> en route to Mars.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Adeona</em> performs TMI and flies to Mars on a minimum-energy Hohmann transfer orbit for ~6 months.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On approach to Mars, <em>Adeona</em>&rsquo;s RCS rotates the vehicle 180&deg; so the engine is facing Mars.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Adeona</em> performs MOI and parks in Mars orbit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Crew transfers from <em>Adeona</em> back into <em>Pern-1</em>, wearing marssuits.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Crew descends to the surface of Mars in <em>Pern-1.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Rover is remotely driven from the Hab to the LZ of <em>Pern-1</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Crew transfer from <em>Pern-1</em> to the Rover through its airlocks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Crew drive the Rover to the Hab.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Crew transfer from the Rover to the Hab through airlocks.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Phase 4: Surface Mission</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The crew spend 1-2 weeks in the Hab, setting up their living space and adapting to Mars gravity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surface mission for ~18 months.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Phase 5: Crew Return (2035)</h2>

  <figcaption>Bat chart - Crew return</figcaption>
</figure>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>About 1-2 months before departure, commence systems checks of <em>Athena</em> and <em>Adeona</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On departure, Hab is placed in standby/ISRU mode, in preparation for arrival of the next crew in ~8 months.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Crew transfer to the Rover in marssuits, along with their boxes of samples for bringing back to Earth (or these may have been delivered to <em>Athena</em> previously).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The crew drives the Rover to <em>Athena</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Crew transfer, with samples, to <em>Athena</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Rover is remotely driven back to the Surface Hab, so it won&#39;t be affected by the launch of the MAV.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The upper two stages of <em>Athena</em> (ascent stage and <em>Pern-2</em>) launch from Mars surface, leaving behind the descent stage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Pern-2</em> performs MOR (Mars Orbit Rendezvous) and docks with <em>Adeona</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Crew transfer, with samples, from <em>Pern-2</em> to <em>Adeona</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Pern-2</em> is undocked and discarded on Mars, rather than remaining docked and used for EDL at Earth. Although this appears to be more expensive (costs an additional Falcon 9 + DragonRider), this is done for three reasons:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Planetary protection. <em>Pern-2</em> has been sitting on Mars for 44 months and could be contaminated. We don&rsquo;t know that there&rsquo;s not life on Mars, so we shouldn&rsquo;t bring it into Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Reduces mass of <em>Pern-2</em>, as no heat shield, thrusters or fuel is required for Earth EDL. This greatly helps to minimise the mass landed on and launched from Mars.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Without a capsule docked to the MTV, less fuel is required for the return flight to Earth.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Adeona</em> performs TEI and flies back to Earth on a minimum-energy Hohmann transfer orbit for ~6 months.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On approach to Earth, <em>Adeona</em>&rsquo;s RCS rotates the vehicle 180&deg; so the engine is facing Earth.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Adeona</em> performs EOI and parks on Earth orbit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Falcon 9 with <em>Pern-3</em> (empty DragonRider) is launched from Earth.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Pern-3</em> performs EOR with <em>Adeona</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Crew transfer themselves and samples from <em>Adeona</em> to <em>Pern-3.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Pern-3</em> undocks from <em>Adeona</em> and performs EDL to Earth surface.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Crew and samples are quarantined.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Phase 6: Recover/Prepare</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Alpha Crew commence physical rehabilitation to restore fitness.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Alpha Crew extensively debriefed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Send more power hardware etc. to the IMRS.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Missions to connect new propulsion stages and refurbish <em>Adeona</em>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
