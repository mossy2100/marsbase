<p>Cost is a major factor in any space venture, and in light of shrinking space agency budgets and an increasing need to allocate public money to more pressing issues, it has become an even more important consideration. NASA&rsquo;s nominal benchmark for implementing the DRA is up to $100 billion for the full program lifecycle, including all development costs and three missions. However, with the following considerations it should be possible to achieve a total cost well below this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The mission architecture is largely assembled from commercially-available (COTS) hardware components, which are cheaper to purchase than it is to develop custom-designed components.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All three missions are to the same location, therefore major components such as the MTV, Surface Hab, Rover, greenhouse and ATV&rsquo;s can be reused by multiple crews. The architecture is specifically organised for component reuse across multiple missions (at least 3).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As an international mission, some of the engineering, development and other work will be done by countries where costs of labour, rent and other overheads are considerably lower than in the US, such as China and India.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Our goal should not be to do the cheapest possible H2M mission, as overly aggressive cost-cutting measures compromise safety and results. Our goal should be to do the smartest one, with the appropriate balance of cost, safety and ROI (Return On Investment). However, whatever else the architecture may be, it must be affordable. As was observed with the 90-Day Report, with its bottom line of $450 billion, an excessively high price tag simply makes the program nonviable.</p>

<p>By assembling a mission from primarily commercially available products and services, combined with successful management, logistics and financing, the goal of sending humans to Mars is within reach. Although further calculations still need to be done, with this architecture and an internationally collaborative approach it should be possible to implement a full program, including robotic precursor missions and three crewed surface missions, for well under $100 billion, and perhaps as low as $50 billion.</p>

<p>For the purpose of this exercise a ballpark figure of $72 billion is used, which, in theory, should be a maximum. This amounts to an average cost per crew slot of $4 billion, or an average of $200 million per crew slot, per year, for two decades (~2020-40). The hope is that this amount will be affordable for the top 10 space agencies.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Cost benefits of a single location</h2>

<p>In the DRA, because the crew are landed in the habitat, and because each mission is to a different location, this obviously necessitates three habitats, three Mars Ascent Vehicles, and three sets of surface vehicles and ISRU equipment.</p>

<p>However, by constraining ourselves to a single location, we can spend less money and use the available resources more creatively in order to achieve a permanent human presence on Mars (PHP-M) more quickly. Since the crew arrive by DragonRider rather than landing in the Surface Hab, only one Surface Hab is needed, as subsequent missions can reuse the same one, just like with FMARS or MDRS. The same applies for the ground vehicles. This obviously represents a huge cost saving; not only the cost of the actual hardware elements, but the more substantial cost of sending them.</p>

<p>Once the Surface Hab and Rover are at the IMRS, we only need to deliver another MAV, crew and supplies in order to run the mission again. However, if financial resources are available to send additional hardware on the second or third Blue Dragon mission, rather than waste this on identical hardware it will be possible to send an additional Surface Hab or Rover, cargo modules, a greenhouse, inflatable modules, additional power production or ISRU hardware, equipment for excavation or experiments, or other useful items of hardware that develop the IMRS and bring us yet closer to PHP-M. This would be a better use of the money.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Commercial hardware</h2>

<p>The most important goals of Blue Dragon are to reduce costs and increase safety and the likelihood of success compared with existing proposals. These goals are all arguably made more achievable through utilisation of primarily COTS hardware, such as Falcon rockets, Dragon capsules and Raptor engines from SpaceX, and inflatable space station modules from Bigelow Aerospace.</p>

<p>Rather than having a collection of one-off custom-built components that only a few specialist engineers understand, using COTS components gives several advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>COTS components often have a greater operational maturity and a higher TRL (Technology Readiness Level) than custom-built hardware. They may have been used in multiple real-life applications, perhaps many times, enabling refinement and better understanding of the design. This drastically improves confidence in the technology and reduces the likelihood of design flaws. Although this may not currently apply to the Falcon Heavy or the BA 330, as these are new and developing products, it may well apply in the proposed timeline.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>COTS hardware is usually understood by a much larger number of people, including engineers, customers and others who&rsquo;ve used or studied it, who may be numerous if the product is popular or has been in use for some time. This makes problem identification and resolution quicker, easier and more likely to be accurate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>COTS hardware is usually cheaper than purpose-built hardware because with each successive production run optimisations are made in the product design, supply chain and manufacturing processes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Components produced in quantity, rather than one-off, are usually cheaper - sometimes orders of magnitude cheaper - due to the cost savings obtained by mass production.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It&rsquo;s always more expensive to build a prototype than a reproduction, because creating a prototype always involves an element of involves real-time interactive design. The development of a prototype involves numerous iterations, modifications and redesigns, and several usually need to be made before the final version is considered ready for reproduction. When using COTS hardware, this work has already been completed and paid for, saving both time and money.</p>

<p>The total lifecycle cost of any hardware component in a space mission may be calculated using the following formula:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>C<sub>total</sub> = C<sub>dev</sub> + C<sub>man</sub> + C<sub>trans</sub> + C<sub>op</sub> + C<sub>dec</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>where</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>C<sub>total</sub> = the total lifecycle cost of the item</p>

  <p>C<sub>dev</sub> = the cost of development</p>

  <p>C<sub>man</sub> = the cost of manufacture</p>

  <p>C<sub>trans</sub> = the cost of transportation and installation</p>

  <p>C<sub>op</sub> = the cost of operation</p>

  <p>C<sub>dec</sub> = the cost of decommissioning</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The main benefit of using COTS hardware is that C<sub>dev</sub>, which, in a traditional space mission, is a major expense (on the order of millions to billions of dollars depending on the item) is considerably lower per item because it&rsquo;s recovered across multiple sales, and shrinks towards zero over time. In addition, C<sub>man</sub> is often lower due to the cost benefits of mass production. Even C<sub>trans</sub>, which is the total transportation cost from the manufacturer to the final destination (e.g. Mars), may be lower if a transport system designed especially for the item is available, such as we have with the SpaceX Falcon rocket family and the Dragon capsule. C<sub>op</sub> and C<sub>dec</sub> may also have been optimised over multiple deployments.</p>

<p>We are living in a different era to any in which a H2M mission has been developed before. The private space sector is experiencing a revolution, characterised by an exponential growth in the number of startups in the space sector, reminiscent of the IT sector during the past three decades. Numerous so-called &ldquo;NewSpace&rdquo; companies are developing commercial space hardware, and the available options are rapidly expanding. Private companies now exist for a wide range of services related to space, including launch services; space station and spacecraft components; satellites; space suits; ECLSS hardware; space electronics; robotics; and other miscellaneous space products and services. The cost of purchasing these items from commercial suppliers is typically much lower than developing them from scratch for one or even three missions.</p>

<p>By taking advantage of this proliferation of commercial products and services, the cost of transporting people and equipment to Mars can be significantly lower than previous estimates. As the design for the Blue Dragon mission evolves, the intention is to track new developments in COTS hardware and take advantage of these where possible, in order to further evolve and improve the architecture.</p>

<p>COTS hardware suppliers sometimes collaborate in ways that support the assembly of mission architectures. For example, SpaceX and Bigelow Aerospace have begun discussions about developing a common docking interface that will enable Dragon capsules to dock with Bigelow&rsquo;s inflatable space station modules for delivery of cargo and crew. This will be a valuable design feature that will save money in development costs.</p>

<p>Although a reasonably young company, SpaceX is favoured in the architecture as it currently stands, primarily because their hardware is comparatively very cheap and also very good. Most importantly, SpaceX are making their rockets reusable, which, it&rsquo;s claimed, will reduce the cost of launching anything into space by a factor of 100.</p>

<p>Focusing on a single technology for surface-to-space and space-to-surface crew transport, and using fundamentally the same tech to deliver cargo to the surface of Mars, will significantly reduce mission complexity and cost and generally improves robustness.</p>

<p>Having said that, as an international mission, it&rsquo;s possible that major players such as Russia and China will want their own hardware (e.g. rockets) to be represented. Solving this to all partners&rsquo; satisfaction will require successfully and diplomatically balancing these desires with cost and safety. It will be important for all partners to understand that a decision to use hardware predominantly from one supplier would not be intended deliberately to favour that supplier&rsquo;s country, but, rather, to make the program affordable and viable.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Development</h2>

<p>Components unavailable from commercial suppliers must still be developed, and this may require a substantial investment. However, current trends indicate this cost will decrease as more commercial space hardware suppliers and components become available, and as the space industry becomes increasingly confident in its own evolution and the expansion of the market. Considering the vast range of technical services now available in the space community, it should be possible to develop any remaining requirements within more modest time frames and budgets than have previously been considered. The development of any major component should begin with a comprehensive survey of products and services available from commercial suppliers.</p>

<p>Examples of technological components that still need to be developed include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A reliable EDL system for delivering loads to of 10-40 tonne payloads to Mars surface.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A reliable method of transporting a crew from Mars surface to Mars orbit (i.e., a Mars Ascent Vehicle).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A reliable and lightweight (&lt; 50 kg) Mars Activity Suit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Proven technology for manufacturing propellant, breathable air and potable water from the local Martian environment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Effective techniques and technologies for dealing with Martian dust and radiation.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The expense of developing these components is not necessarily a sunk cost. Because there&rsquo;s a clear desire in the population for settlement of Mars, initiatives such as Mars One and Blue Dragon will be followed up by other human exploration and settlement programs, both public and private. As these technologies will be of value to any human mission, they could be licensed, sold, or developed into new COTS products, providing opportunities to recover the initial investment and potentially make a profit.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Sharing the cost</h2>

<p>The IMRS plan is made yet more viable by distributing the cost across a consortium of multiple space agencies in a similar fashion to the ISS.</p>

<p>As a very rough estimate, imagine an approximate total program cost of $72 billion. This is based on the nominal NASA budget of $100 billion for a total cost for implementing the DRA, and the total cost of the ISS of $150 billion, revised downwards by the cost-reduction strategies described. It is essentially a guess, but will do for this exercise. A full analysis needs to be done to determine a more accurate total cost estimate.</p>

<p>This $72 billion is for three missions ($24B each, on average) to send a crew of six to Mars and back, with a total program duration of approximately two decades: one to prepare and develop, one to execute. The overall program therefore offers a total of eighteen crew slots with an approximate average cost of $4 billion each, thus averaging $200M per year per crew slot.</p>

<p>In order to preserve the truly international nature of each crew, and to permit a larger international partnership with each agency represented by at least one astronaut, we set a restriction that any one space agency can &ldquo;purchase&rdquo; a maximum of one crew slot per mission.</p>

<p>The total investment by the US and Russia (&ldquo;Level A&rdquo; partners), with one astronaut on each mission, would therefore be approximately $12 billion each. The total investment by &ldquo;Level B&rdquo; partners (e.g. Europe, China, Japan, India) would be about $8 billion each, and the total investment by smaller &ldquo;Level C&rdquo; partners would be about $4 billion each.</p>

<p>Because the economies of the participating nations are quite different, and because $200M per year is comparable to, or larger than, many space agencies&rsquo; entire budgets, it&rsquo;s possible that investment could be made partially or wholly &ldquo;in kind&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;in cash&rdquo;. For example, a space agency may contribute an equivalent value in engineering, launch services, hardware or facilities.</p>

<p>Ideas for implementing the program as an international partnership is discussed further in the <a href="/international-partnership">International Partnership</a> section.</p>
