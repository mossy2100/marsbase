<h2>Crew size</h2>

<p>The Mars Semi-Direct and NASA DRA architectures specify crews of six, although the Mars Direct and MARS-OZ architectures require only four. Although it may be possible that a smaller crew could suffice, Blue Dragon is designed for six. There are a variety of reasons for this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It&rsquo;s about as large a crew as we can handle while keeping the mission achievable and affordable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A crew of six permits a dedicated crew member for the most crucial functions, while also allowing for a degree of redundancy in skill coverage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The DRA and other architectures have been designed for a crew of six, therefore we can leverage existing research.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A single Bigelow Aerospace BA 330 module, the habitat section of Adeona, is designed to support six people.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A SpaceX DragonRider capsule is designed for seven people. It should be large enough for six crew in spacesuits, with some additional space for samples.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It permits a greater degree of flexibility with team configurations.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Since the BA 330 provides life support and ample volume for six people, to design the mission for less would be inefficient.</p>

<p>Why not five, or three, or seven? The Apollo crews had three members. There&rsquo;s one main advantage to having an odd number of people in the crew: it means that you never get a tied vote. However, it also means you can&rsquo;t use the buddy system. The &ldquo;buddy system&rdquo; is something kids learn in school, but is also a good idea for H2M missions. It simply means that everyone works in pairs. Your partner is your &ldquo;buddy&rdquo;, and it&rsquo;s their job to keep you company, watch your back, and make sure you don&rsquo;t fall into a collapsed lava tube or anything like that. In turn, you do the same for them. This is important for safety as well as psychological health.</p>

<p>Naturally, the crew will not always be able to all work together. However, for safety and psychological reasons we may want to avoid any crew member being left alone; at least, they shouldn&rsquo;t work alone.</p>

<p>Six people can be organised as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Three teams of two</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two teams of three</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A team of four and a team of two</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This flexibility can be useful when organising shifts, EHA&rsquo;s and chores, and it means no-one works alone and safety and happiness is optimised.</p>

<p>With a 3-person crew, either the three would always stay together, or people would often have to work alone. With a 4-person crew, if no-one is to work alone, the only team configuration available is two pairs of two. With a 5-person crew, there&rsquo;s also only one option: a team of two and a team of three.</p>

<p>While 3-5 people may be enough in terms of skills, we have capacity for six and a crew of six offers greater advantages.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Crew roles</h2>

<p>Each crew member on this mission will need to be capable of fulfilling multiple roles, from coder to videographer to commander. All occupations are crucial to the mission and require redundant backups. Therefore each astronaut on the mission must be trained in multiple roles.</p>

<p>The crew is comprised of two basic teams: engineering and science, each with three members. The engineers ostensibly have different roles; however, they must all also be able to fix any of the mission hardware, and therefore, to a large degree, be able to do each other&rsquo;s jobs.</p>

<h3>Flight and Mechanical Engineer, and Commander</h3>

<p>This role requires understanding, operating and maintaining all vehicles, including Adeona, Success and the Rover. This person is not only the mechanical engineer, but also the mechanic. As commander, they must liaise with Mission Operations on Earth, and make executive decisions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Mechatronics and Communications Engineer</h3>

<p>This role will include responsibility for all computers and mechatronic equipment, including flight computers, on-board computers in the rover, robotic systems, multimedia/web servers, personal computers, and more. They will also be responsible for all communications hardware used in space and on Mars.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Chemical and Electrical Engineer</h3>

<p>This person is responsible for operating, maintaining and repairing all chemical engineering hardware in the habitat and various spacecraft, including fuel systems, ISRU systems, ECLSS, waste disposal systems and plumbing. They are also in charge of monitoring and maintaining all power and electrical systems.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Planetary Scientist and Astronomer</h3>

<p>This role combines geology, planetary science, astronomy and cartography. On the surface of Mars they will study areology, areomorphology, areochemistry, areography, etc., and in space they will perform Earth, Mars and astronomical observation. They will be responsible for any telescopes used in space and on Mars, and producing maps of the IMRS site and surrounding area.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Astrobiologist and Astrohorticulturist</h3>

<p>This role includes searching for and (if found) examining extant life on the surface of Mars, and conducting experiments with food production in Adeona and in a greenhouse or laboratory on Mars.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Medical and Safety Officer</h3>

<p>This person is responsible for keeping the crew alive and healthy. This critical role combines ship&rsquo;s doctor, personal trainer, psychologist, and safety officer. It includes monitoring crew health and effects of microgravity and radiation, taking crew members through daily exercise routines, providing nutritional advice, administering medications and treatments, monitoring psychological health of the crew, monitoring solar flares and conducting safety drills, and developing and implementing safety protocols.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Journalist duties</h3>

<p>If we could squeeze one more person into the mission (if a BA 330 could be made capable of supporting 7, for example) it would be tempting to include a dedicated journalist and communicator, whose responsibility would be documentation and communications, including writing, photography, videography, blogging, interviews and other forms of reporting. This would be tremendously valuable to any space mission, as it would drastically increase engagement with the public (i.e. viewing audience) on Earth. This will generate a greater ROI across the board, helping to justify the cost of the mission, improve revenues (if that should be important), and generate a higher volume of feedback and good wishes for the crew, thus improving morale and decreasing feelings of isolation.</p>

<p>However, as ideal as it might be, it would be hard to justify. The alternative, which might in fact produce a better result, is to train all crew members in basic journalism and communications. Another approach would be to assign journalism duties to the Planetary Scientist and/or Biologist during the space travel stages of the mission, since they may not be able to do as much science during that time. The two scientists could share the responsibility once on the surface, or all the crew members could engage in daily or weekly reporting of their individual activities.</p>

<p>Alternatively, there may simply be one or two crew members who are naturally more extroverted, expressive, and better suited to journalist-style duties, and who may voluntarily take on much of that role. For example, a person like Carl Sagan or Neil deGrasse Tyson, who could take the the role of both scientist and science communicator.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Colour coding</h3>

<p>Once the crew has been selected, they will each be assigned a unique, distinct colour, which is theirs until the end of the mission. These colours are used for everything that belongs to that astronaut - their bunk, spacesuit, treat meals, clothes packs, towels, everything. Everyone in the crew will learn everyone&rsquo;s colours.</p>

<p>Apart from the advantages of not mixing up your towel with someone else&rsquo;s, one of the primary advantages of having distinct spacesuit colours is that it will be easy to identify who&rsquo;s who during EVA, when it may be difficult to see each other&rsquo;s faces or bodies. Brown, orange and pink are excluded due to similarity with local colours on the Mars surface. Red should actually be ok, since, despite Mars being known as the &quot;red planet&quot;, there&rsquo;s not a lot of actual red in the landscape.</p>
