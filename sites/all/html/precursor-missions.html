<p>Apollos 11-17 succeeded because of Apollos 1-10. The hardware tests and missions that preceded the human landings tested each element of the target mission, improving confidence in the architecture and the TRL of each hardware component.</p>

<p>Precursor missions are not often described in conjunction with H2M architectures, perhaps because of the exorbitant cost of sending packages to Mars, or perhaps because the human mission itself is complex enough to describe. However, if the Red Dragon technology can reliably deliver 2-tonne payloads to Mars surface for under $200M per launch, including the capsule, we can afford, and should implement, a program of precursor missions that prove and develop the technology and build the necessary confidence for the human missions.</p>

<p>A program of precursor missions will enable us to improve the architecture. The program will ideally include the following experiments, some of which can be bundled together into the same mission:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Test of the MAV, including EDL, ISPP, launch and ascent to orbit (everything up to but excluding MOR).</li>
  <li>Test of an ISAP system to produce breathable air from Martian atmosphere.</li>
  <li>Test of ISWP systems based on WAVAR to collect water from the atmosphere, and the AWESOM rover to collect water from the ground.</li>
  <li>Test of power production using rolls of PV material.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are combined into the following proposed missions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Green Dragon</strong>, which is a robotic lander that tests power production, ISAP and ISWP. Water is collected from Mars using an AWESOM rover, Martian atmosphere is collected, and these are combined and processed in various ways to produce breathable air and potable water. This mission also tests the use of PV blankets for surface power. This mission may additionally test ISPP, depending on mass and budget constraints.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Gold Dragon</strong>, which is a MAV and ISPP test. A MAV is landed on Mars, a PV blanket unrolled for power, the ISPP unit is operated, LOX/LCH4 bipropellant is produced, the MAV is launched from Mars surface, and the ascent capsule flies to an orbit matching where the MTV will be, as if ready for MOR (although it won&rsquo;t be possible without the MTV on orbit). This tests EDL, ISPP, the use of PV blankets for surface power, ascent stages, and operation of the modified DragonRider.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In a perfect world we would have a complete run-through of the mission with no&nbsp;crew involved, i.e. predeploy everything, construct the MTV, robotically fly it out to Mars, have it wait on orbit for 1.5 years, launch the MAV and dock the ascent capsule with the MTV, undock it, robotically fly the MTV back to Earth and park on Earth orbit. However, this would be a long and expensive test, and it remains to be seen if it&rsquo;s practical, or if a combination of simpler precursor missions, simulations, and Earth-based missions will suffice, as they did with Apollo.</p>
