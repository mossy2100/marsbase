<h3>Earth surface to orbit</h3>

<p>The current engines&nbsp;used by SpaceX and many other modern rockets utilise LOX/RP1 as propellant. However, as mentioned, SpaceX are currently developing an LOX/LCH4 rocket engine named Raptor that may potentially be used for Earth launches.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>In space (Earth orbit to Mars orbit and Mars orbit to Earth orbit)</h3>

<p>Many chemical propulsion systems designed for interplanetary transport use LOX/LH2 as propellant due to its high specific impulse. However, for <em>Adeona</em> this may be less than ideal, as she must carry the crew to Mars, and then back again after loitering on Mars orbit for 18 months. Hydrogen is notoriously difficult to store for long periods in space, especially in the vacuum of space, as it leaks away, or &ldquo;boils off&rdquo;. A typical boil-off rate for hydrogen in space is about 3.8% per month, therefore, if <em>Adeona</em>&nbsp;uses LOX/LH2 propellant, a non-trivial additional quantity of hydrogen would be required to compensate for this. In spite of this, the chemical propulsion version of the transportation systems designed for NASA&rsquo;s DRA currently specify RL10B-2 engines from Pratt and Whitney Rocketdyne for the MTV, which use LOX/LH2.</p>

<p>Because of the long period <em>Adeona</em> must wait on orbit it may be preferable to use a storable propellant such as mono-methyl hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide, like SpaceX&rsquo;s SuperDraco engines. However, it remains to be seen if this is practical. It may even use LOX/LCH4. It&rsquo;s likely as settlement of Mars progresses that methane engines will become more common, as it offers a range of advantages including the fact that it can be manufactured on Mars and at other locations in the Solar System relatively simply.</p>

<p>At this stage more exotic propulsion methods such as nuclear thermal rockets, ion propulsion, VASIMR, plasma thrusters, etc., are not under consideration for use in Blue Dragon. However, that may change if they can be shown to be superior in terms of cost, safety and performance. Chemical propulsion has a high TRL, is comparatively cheap, and more exotic or expensive propulsion systems are not required for human missions to Mars. The DRA includes two alternative designs for transportation systems, namely chemical propulsion and NTR&rsquo;s (Nuclear Thermal Rockets). Although NTR&rsquo;s may provide a thrust around twice that of any chemical propulsion system, they would be much more costly (unavailable as COTS products), take longer to develop, are arguably much more dangerous, may be difficult to get approved, and would also require long-term cryogenic storage of liquid hydrogen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Mars orbit to surface, and Earth orbit to surface</h3>

<p>SpaceX Dragon and DragonRider capsules designed for ground landings on Earth will include eight SuperDraco engines, which use a hypergolic storable propellant (mono-methyl hydrazine as fuel and nitrogen tetroxide as oxidiser). It seems likely they would use the same engines for Mars.</p>

<p>As for the MAV and Surface Hab, the DRA goes into some detail about how masses of this scale (20+ tonnes) could be landed on Mars, with the following conclusion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The reference EDL architecture that was ultimately selected for this study was a hypersonic aeroassist entry system, with a mid lift-to-drag ratio (L/D) aeroshell that was ejected at low supersonic Mach numbers. An LOX/LCH4-fuelled propulsion system was used for deorbit delta-V maneuvers, RCS control during the entry phase, and final terminal descent to the surface.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore, LOX/LCH4 engines are proposed for all aspects of Mars EDL. To manage costs, ideally we will have access to a COTS engine for this purpose; however, at present there are no methane-fuelled engines that would be suitable, and it therefore may be necessary to develop a new engine. Alternatively, we may consider something like SpaceX SuperDraco engines.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Mars surface to orbit</h3>

<p>The MAV&rsquo;s ascent stage carries the crew from Mars surface to orbit. These will use LOX/LCH4 propellant produced from local Martian resources, as described below in the section on ISPP. One candidate engine may be the new Raptor engine currently in development by SpaceX, as this may well be reason for its development.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>ISPP (In Situ Propellant Production)</h2>

<p>It is for this reason that ISRU concepts were first developed for Mars. A fully-fuelled MAV weighs considerably (tens of tonnes) more than a dry one, which would require a far more elaborate and expensive EDL system. It has been shown that if the majority of the LOX/LCH4 propellant for Mars ascent is manufactured at Mars, the resulting mass saving could potentially reduce the cost of a human mission to Mars as much as a factor of eight (Zubrin et al., 1991).</p>

<p>The ISPP process currently envisaged for the MAV closely parallels that described in the Mars Direct architecture. The main differences are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>As in the DRA and Mars Semi-Direct, only enough propellant needs to be manufactured to carry to the MAV, not all the way back to Earth as in Mars Direct.</li>
  <li>An important goal of Blue Dragon precursor missions (2015-2030) is to develop the capability to obtain water from regolith. If this effort is successful then the MAV will not carry H2 from Earth but will obtain instead it, and O2 from locally-produced water.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the DRA, CH4 is brought from Earth and O2 is manufactured at Mars. In Mars Direct, H2, which represents the lightest fraction of the propellant yet also the most difficult to obtain from local Martian resources, is carried from Earth. This is reacted with CO2 obtained from the Martian atmosphere in order to produce CH4 and O2, which are liquified and stored cryogenically.&nbsp;Additional O2 is obtained from CO2 via RWGS, which produces H2O that is then electrolysed to H2 and O2.</p>

<p>In Blue Dragon H2 will ideally be obtained from water extracted from the surrounding regolith, which is electrolysed into H2 and O2. It has been shown that a useful fraction of the water frozen in the top layer of regolith can be liberated using microwave radiation (Ethridge and Kaukler, 2012).</p>

<p>The optimal stoichiometric ratio for LOX/LCH4 bipropellant is 3.5. The DRA specifies a fuel requirement of 21,490kg of CH4 (for two ascent stages), therefore - assuming, for now, that we accept this amount - the amount of LOX required is 75,215kg.</p>

<p>If the decision is made to use local water then the MAV design in Blue Dragon will be somewhat different than the one proposed in the DRA:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It will bring no hydrogen from Earth, and therefore no associated storage tanks</li>
  <li>It will include an AWESOM rover</li>
  <li>It will be topped with a modified DragonRider</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite these differences, until the exact fuel requirements for this MAV are calculated figures from the DRA are used below.</p>

<p>The process is as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> On arrival at Mars, the AWESOM robot is deployed. It&rsquo;s first task is to unroll a solar blanket out of the descent stage of the MAV, providing power to the ISPP system.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> CO2 is obtained from the Martian atmosphere by filtering out dust, removing water via zeolite adsorption, and freezing the CO2 out of the remaining gas mix, enabling it to be separated from the remaining gases. The small amount of water captured by zeolite adsorption is sent to the water tank.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> The AWESOM rover traverses back and forth across a nearby patch of ground, heating and microwaving the regolith below and collecting the released water. At the end of each sol, the rover returns to the MAV to deliver its payload of water. The rover will require some form of LPS so it knows what ground it has already covered.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Water is separated into hydrogen and oxygen gas via electrolysis:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2 H2O(l) &rarr; 2 H2(g) + O2(g)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The O2 is stored cryogenically as LOX.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> CH4 is produced by reacting CO2 obtained from the Martian atmosphere with H2 produced in step 3, via the Sabatier reaction:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CO2(g) + 4 H2(g) &rarr; CH4(g) + 2 H2O(v)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Sabatier reaction occurs at high temperatures, optimally around 600K. Water produced by the reaction is stored in the water tank, and is used by the electrolysis unit to produce more hydrogen and oxygen.</p>

</figure>

<p>Combining the reactions in step 3 and 4, the overall result is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CO2(g) + 2 H2O(g) &rarr; CH4(g) + 2 O2(g)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>59.1 tonnes of CO2 combined with 48.4 tonnes of water (a total of 107.5 tonnes) will produce 21.5 tonnes of CH4 and 86 tonnes of O2. This gives us a surplus of nearly 11 tonnes of O2 that may be used to supplement air supplies for the Hab or the Rover.</p>

<p>The Martian atmosphere is approximately 96% CO2, therefore obtaining 59.1 tonnes of CO2 requires processing about 61.6 tonnes of atmosphere. The density of the atmosphere at the surface of Mars is about 0.02kg/m<sup>3</sup>, so this is about 3.1 million cubic metres of atmosphere.</p>

<p>If our goal is for the MAV to be fully fuelled within 20 months (the time difference between the arrival of the MAV at Mars and the departure of the crew from Earth), that means processing about 103kg (5,130m<sup>3</sup>) of atmosphere per day. It remains to be seen how achievable this is. There is 44 months between the arrival and departure of the MAV, therefore a slower processing rate may still be acceptable.</p>
