<p>Welcome to the International Mars Research Station, a plan to bring the world&rsquo;s leading space-faring nations together to cooperate in the establishment of a permanent human presence on Mars.</p>

<p>This website presents a program of near-term, affordable and achievable missions to send international crews of six people to Mars and return them safely to Earth, while developing a base on Mars. The intention is an initial step towards settlement. The concept for the base is the International Mars Research Station (IMRS), a shared facility developed by a partnership comprised of the world&rsquo;s top space agencies, for use by <em>all</em> nations and peoples.</p>

<p>This plan is supported by a modern, practical, safe and affordable architecture for human Mars missions called &ldquo;Blue Dragon&rdquo;, which makes use of the latest advancements in space technology. This architecture has been developed as an evolution of the <a href="/nasa-design-reference-architecture">NASA Design Reference Architecture 5.0</a> (Mars Architecture Steering Group, 2009), incorporating a number of innovations designed to reduce costs and to maximise safety, the probability of success, and the overall benefit to humanity.</p>

<p>The main difference from the DRA is the choice to focus on a single location rather than several, thereby enabling reuse of hardware elements across multiple missions. Another important difference is the decision to use reusable rockets and reusable interplanetary spacecraft. Another aspect of the plan is to utilise commercial off-the-shelf hardware components such as capsules, rockets, engines, spacesuits and inflatable spacecraft modules, in order to further reduce expenses by saving on development costs. ISRU (In Situ Resource Utilisation) technology is used for manufacturing propellant and breathable air, and ideally also water, thereby reducing launch mass and mission cost. This strategy of controlling program cost will reduce obstacles to sending humans to Mars, making it possible to achieve that goal sooner, and will enable more missions to be conducted and more countries to be involved, thereby benefiting more people.</p>

<p>The mission achieves improved safety by using capsules to ferry crews between the surfaces and orbits of both Earth and Mars; pre-deploying virtually all the base hardware, including the Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV), Surface Habitat, surface vehicles (rovers), power systems and ISRU equipment; and providing redundant backup systems to the base (e.g. additional hab, rovers, solar panels, etc.)</p>

<p>IMRS and the Blue Dragon architecture are designed as a first step in a broader process of settlement rather than a standalone Apollo-style &ldquo;flags and footprints&rdquo; program of purely science and/or exploration. This affects the destination of the mission, as well as surface activities. The reasoning is that science and exploration can proceed more easily and rapidly once a permanent human presence has been established. Research activities during surface stay will be oriented around science, exploration and engineering, primarily in the context of supporting habitation of Mars and settlement.</p>

<p>It is hoped that you will enjoy learning more about this exciting project, which has the potential to bring the world together in a peaceful and tremendously historic adventure: opening up a new world for human civilisation. It&rsquo;s important to note that this website currently serves purely a means of presenting and sharing this idea, and at the time of writing no space agencies are attached to it, or, probably, even aware of it. If and when this changes, the site will be updated to reflect that. Part of the reason for building this website is to present the idea and hopefully to engage the interest of space-faring nations and space companies.</p>
