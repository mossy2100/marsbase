<p>Breathable air is required in the Transit and Surface Habs, the Rover, the DragonRider capsules, and in marssuits. Note that, as per NASA policy, the crew will always be wearing their marssuits inside the DragonRider capsules, although they should only need to breathe from the suits during descent to, and ascent from, Mars.</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		<p><strong>Transit Hab:</strong> Although the finer details of the BA 330 are currently unavailable, presumably it will be inflated and pressurised with breathable air from canisters of compressed O2 and N2. Its built-in ECLSS will maintain the air quality during the outbound and return missions, in much the same way as the ISS: scrubbing excess water vapour, carbon dioxide and other contaminants from the habitat atmosphere, and topping up with oxygen and nitrogen as required.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong>Surface Hab:</strong> The Surface Hab (another BA 330) will have air in it when landed, however, it will also include a compact and lightweight ISAP system to manufacture breathable air from the local Martian environment. This is necessary to provide surplus air to inflate the Surface Hab to the desired operating pressure, refresh the Rover&rsquo;s atmosphere, refill oxygen tanks for marssuits, and replace losses due to airlock cycling.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong>Marssuits:</strong> Marssuits will provide astronauts with pure oxygen to breathe, and will scrub exhaled carbon dioxide with something like lithium hydroxide canisters. The suits&rsquo; O2 tanks will be refillable from the Surface Hab&rsquo;s ISAP system.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong>Rover:</strong> The pressurised Rover, being airtight, will initially contain normal Terran air on landing, and will include a compact ECLSS to support extended excursions. However, it will also be possible to top up or freshen its air supply by connecting with the Surface Hab&rsquo;s ISAP system.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong><em>Pern-1</em>:</strong> This DragonRider carries the crew from Earth surface to orbit, then docks with <em>Adeona</em>. Therefore it will initially contain normal Terran air, which will merge with the spacecraft atmosphere after docking. On arrival at Mars, <em>Pern-1</em> carries the crew, wearing marssuits, from Mars orbit to the surface. It will initially contain air from <em>Adeona</em>. When they arrive at Mars surface and pop the hatch, that air will escape and <em>Pern-1</em> will fill with Martian atmosphere. However, the crew will be breathing pure oxygen from their suits.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong><em>Pern-2</em>:</strong> This DragonRider, which initially sits atop the MAV, carries the crew from Mars surface to orbit at the end of the surface mission. After the crew has entered it will contain Martian atmosphere, but the crew will be wearing their marssuits and breathing pure O2. Upon docking with <em>Adeona</em>, the capsule&#39;s atmosphere will be evacuated and refilled with air from inside <em>Adeona</em> before the crew transfer into the Transit Hab.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong><em>Pern-3</em>:</strong> This DragonRider is launched from Earth and will therefore contain normal Terran atmosphere. When it docks with <em>Adeona</em> the air in it will mix with the spacecraft atmosphere, which will be virtually the same. The crew can then enter the capsule and descend to Earth surface.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Atmosphere design</h2>

<h3><strong>The Transit Hab</strong></h3>

<p>The atmosphere inside the Transit Hab will be very similar to normal Terran conditions, with one atmosphere (101.3kPa) pressure comprised of approximately 21% O2 and 79% N2, plus small amounts of CO2 and H2O. This matches the ISS, the Shuttle, Vostok, Mir and other space stations and spacecraft.</p>

<p>The reasons why an Earth-like atmosphere is preferred for use in space are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<p>Discounting hyopgravity effects, the behaviour of the atmosphere is predictable in terms of its interaction with people, animals, plants and equipment.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>It reduces the cost of equipment inside the spacecraft. Rather than having to design equipment for a specialised atmosphere, as was necessary with Apollo, Skylab and many other early spacecraft, with an Earth-normal atmosphere many ordinary COTS items developed for Earth can be used in the spacecraft.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>No adaptation is required for astronauts when moving between the spacecraft and Earth. Physiological effects of long-term exposure to a reduced pressure or low-oxygen atmosphere are not a consideration.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>No time or energy is required to pressurise or depressurise capsules for crew transport to or from Earth.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>A high percentage of buffer gas greatly reduces fire risk.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Although details about the BA 330 are yet to be made available, it seems highly likely it will be designed for an Earth-normal atmosphere, as one of its proposed applications is space tourism.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Surface Hab</h3>

<p>The advantages of a normal Terran atmosphere apply equally well to the Surface Hab as they do to the Transit Hab. However, there are several compelling reasons for a reduced atmospheric pressure for the Surface Hab:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		<p>Reduction in the Surface Hab mass.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Reduction in the volume of air to be manufactured, which therefore reduces the mass and energy requirements of the ISAP system.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Potential for a zero prebreathe (ZPB) protocol for EHA&rsquo;s.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>The higher the internal atmospheric pressure of the Surface Hab the stronger and therefore heavier it will need to be. This conflicts with our goal of reducing the mass of the Surface Hab as much as possible due to the significant challenge of landing such a heavy object on Mars. Having said that, if we use a COTS item such as a BA 330 module for the Surface Hab there may be little or no difference in habitat mass based on internal air pressure.</p>

<p>Atmospheres in early spacecraft had low total pressure, low oxygen pressure, or both. However, research conducted since then has more clearly defined the limits for extended exposure to artificial atmospheres. What follows is a proposed atmosphere design for the Surface Hab.</p>

<h4>Oxygen pressure</h4>

<p>The minimum partial pressure of oxygen for supporting human physiology is considered to be 16kPa. Some researchers recommend a minimum partial pressure of oxygen of 18kPa for long-duration space missions [DUFFIELD]. This recommendation is based on a previous study about planetary surface habitats [CAMPBELL], which reviewed 33 different considerations related to atmospheric pressure and composition, and therefore we should be hesitant to ignore it. However, in this plan the Surface Hab atmosphere design accepts a 16kPa oxygen pressure for the very practical reason of enabling a ZPB protocol for EVA&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>From a physiological perspective, an O2 pressure of 16kPa is perfectly safe. This is equivalent to about 2400m altitude. Most people can ascend to this altitude without difficulty, however, altitude sickness may occur above this level. Astronauts can easily be conditioned for an O2 pressure of 16kPa by training in a hypobaric chamber or at this altitude. Note that the partial pressure of oxygen in airline cabins ranges from 16kPa to 18kPa, and more than 140 million people live permanently at an altitude of 2400m or greater.</p>

<p>Acclimatisation to reduced O2 pressure at altitude is characterised by an increase in pulse and breathing rate. It is a consideration that there is already increased strain on the heart in a microgravity environment, and it would be preferable not to cause any further strain; however, the Surface Hab will be in a gravity environment on the surface of Mars, and, although this is still a reduced gravity environment, the effects on the cardiovascular system will not be as severe as in microgravity.</p>

<h4>Total pressure</h4>

<p>A pure oxygen atmosphere introduces an unacceptably high risk of fire, such as that which occurred in the Apollo 1 Command Module. The upper limit of oxygen concentration with regard to fire safety has not clearly defined, but 30% is considered reasonable [CAMPBELL]. This gives us a total atmospheric pressure of 53.333kPa.</p>

<h4>Carbon dioxide pressure</h4>

<p>Nominal atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and H2O must also be determined. According to SMAC (Spacecraft Maximum Allowable Concentrations), the maximum CO2 concentration is 0.7%. A CO2 concentration of 1% can cause drowsiness, with more serious symptoms occurring at higher concentrations. A typical concentration in normal spacecraft operations is 0.5%, which is a reasonable design goal. This gives us a target CO2 partial pressure of about 267Pa.</p>

<h4>Water vapour pressure</h4>

<p>With regard to water vapour, NASA specifies a RH (Relative Humidity) of 30-70%, i.e. an average of about 50%. Our target operating temperature is 295K (about 72&deg;F or 22&deg;C), which is considered optimal for human comfort and productivity, and the saturated water vapour pressure at this temperature and a pressure of 53.333kPa is 2.626kPa. Our target average water vapour partial pressure will be 50% of this, or 1.313kPa.</p>

<h4>Buffer gas pressure</h4>

<p>The required buffer gas pressure can now be calculated by subtracting the partial pressure of O2, CO2 and H2O from the total pressure:</p>

<blockquote>53.333kPa - 16kPa - 0.267kPa - 1.313kPa = 35.754kPa</blockquote>

<p>Note that the buffer gas pressure in the Surface Hab will not be pure N2, as in the Transit Hab. It will in fact be comprised of up to about 50% Ar, depending on how much buffer gas we obtain from the Martian atmosphere. This is explained in greater detail in the section below about the ISAP system.</p>

<h3>Marssuits</h3>

<p>Space suits typically use pure oxygen as breathing gas, which simplifies the PLSS (Personal Life Support System) and reduces the suit mass. Pressures have historically ranged from 26kPa to 57kPa. Space suits with relatively high pressure are sometimes referred to as &ldquo;Zero Prebreathe Spacesuits&rdquo; (ZPS), as they permit an astronaut to transition to the suit without needing to spend any time prebreathing. Prebreathing involves breathing pure oxygen for a period of time, from 30 minutes to several hours, at atmospheric or mid-level pressures in order to purge nitrogen from the blood and other tissues. This is necessary with low-pressure suits to prevent DCS (decompression sickness, also known as &ldquo;the bends&rdquo;).</p>

<p>ZPS&#39;s for Mars are highly desirable, as they would result in considerable saved time and much greater convenience for the crew, who will wish to conduct EVA/EHA most sols. It will also mitigate DCS, and if the suit pressure can be made to match the buffer gas pressure of the habitat, eliminate it. It&rsquo;s easier to achieve this with MCP suits, as these can support a higher pressure while maintaining good mobility. Gas pressurised suits, on the other hand, require as low as possible air pressure in order to facilitate effective mobility and thereby reduce crew fatigue.</p>

<p>The amount of prebreathing is based on the decompression ratio (also known as the R value), which is the ratio between the partial pressure of buffer gases in the spacecraft or habitat atmosphere, and the total pressure in the space suit:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>R = buffer gas partial pressure &divide; total suit pressure</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From JSC-25003 [CAMPBELL] (highlight added):</p>

<blockquote>
	<p><em>An R value of more than 1.0 may have a risk of decompression sickness. This risk increases with increased R value. The risk of decompression sickness during a mission is <span class="highlight">statistically cumulative over a number of decompressions during that mission</span>; therefore, the mission duration and frequency of EVA must be considered when determining an appropriate value for R for a given mission. A statistical analysis of cumulative risk shows that for R=1.22, the risk of decompression sickness after ten decompressions is 7 percent, while for R=1.4 the risk is 37 percent. Therefore, <span class="highlight">cumulative risk is an important criterion for long-term planet surface missions and it increases rapidly as R is increased above 1.0</span>. If the decompressions are not separated by enough time to eliminate previously formed gas bubble nuclei from body tissues, the risk of decompression sickness on subsequent decompressions is also greatly increased.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our crew will be spending approximately 540 days on the surface of Mars, with an estimated 3-4 EHA&rsquo;s per week, for a maximum of around 200-300 each. Considering this very large number of EHA&rsquo;s, ZPB will only be safe for R=1.0, which, if we accept our above habitat atmosphere design, necessitates a marssuit pressure of 35.754kPa.</p>

<p>Current MCP suits, in particular the BioSuit being developed at MIT, support a pressure of approximately 30kPa. As this is an active area of research, it is realistic that MCP suits with an operating pressure of 35.754kPa can be developed in time for a human mission to Mars. From private communications with Dava Newman, Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics and Engineering Systems at MIT and a leading MCP suit researcher:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p><em>We&rsquo;ve made some outstanding progress this semester on our active materials and believe we can now achieve the 30 kPa pressure level. It shouldn&rsquo;t be asking too much for us to achieve the mid-30 kPa, especially by 2030!</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, according to Prof. Newman, it&rsquo;s unlikely that suit pressure much <em>higher</em> than 35kPa will be sought, as this would begin to compromise mobility, which is the primary goal of this suit design. Therefore, an oxygen partial pressure of 16kPa is justified, because, in accordance with other constraints such as the 30% upper limit on oxygen concentration and an R value of 1, the result is a buffer gas pressure of 35kPa. A higher oxygen partial pressure would result in either a greater than 30% oxygen concentration in the habitat atmosphere, and therefore exceeding safe limits with respect to fire risk, <em>or</em> a buffer gas pressure greater than 36kPa, which may be higher than the suit pressure, thus increasing risk of DCS. Fortunately, an atmosphere design able to meet all requirements and safety limits is possible, as described.</p>

<h4>Oxygen toxicity</h4>

<p>It&rsquo;s worth mentioning that this suit pressure is within safe limits for O2 toxicity. As reported in report JSC-25003 [CAMPBELL], oxygen toxicity can occur when exposed to a high partial pressure for an extended period, i.e. above 40.5kPa for more than approximately 24 hours. The same report also states:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>For EVA&rsquo;s of six to eight hours, 100 percent oxygen can be used at pressures up to 41.4 kPa (6.0 psia) with absolutely no risk.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As the proposed suit pressure of 35.754kPa falls below this threshold, oxygen toxicity is not a risk with this design.</p>

<p>More information is provided in the section about <a href="/marssuits-and-airlocks">marssuits and airlocks</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Rover</h3>

<p>Aspects of atmosphere design relevant for the Surface Hab apply equally to the Rover. We wish to provide a safe and healthful atmosphere while keeping the mass of the Rover as low as practical.</p>

<p>There are several advantages if the Rover atmosphere has the same composition and pressure as the Surface Hab:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<p>No adaptation or prebreathing required when transitioning between the Surface Hab and the Rover.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>The same equipment (such as laptops, scientific instruments and sensors) can be used in both environments. This reduces cost and complexity of design, and part counts.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>The same ZPB protocol can be used for both the Surface Hab and the Rover.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>With the Surface Hab and Rover having the same atmospheres it may also be possible to connect the Rover directly to the Surface Hab: perhaps with a person-sized hatch to make it easy to transfer between them without needing to suit up or go through the airlock, or perhaps simply with a pipe to freshen the Rover&rsquo;s air.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>DragonRiders</h3>

<p>For all DragonRiders, the internal atmosphere will be either Earth-normal (or the same as in <em>Adeona</em>, which is virtually Earth-normal), or the crew will be wearing marssuits.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>ISAP (In Situ Air Production)</h2>

<p>The primary constituents of the Martian atmosphere are CO2, N2, Ar, whereas Earth&rsquo;s are mainly N2, O2 and Ar. Therefore, all the elements required to make breathable, Earth-like air are readily available from Martian air.</p>

<p>The Surface Hab is comprised of an inflatable module, and it may be landed partially deflated, or simply with a reduced internal pressure. After landing, the Surface Hab will be remotely activated from Earth, initiating the ISAP system and causing the internal air pressure to increase to the desired level. As we are sending the Surface Hab one launch window earlier than the crew, we will have about 20 months to achieve this and to test the Surface Hab&rsquo;s other systems before the crew leave Earth. In order to increase the Surface Hab&rsquo;s air pressure it will be preferable to make the necessary air using ISRU technology rather than bring air from Earth, which would require heavy tanks and would constrain a resources which some basic equipment can procure in abundance from Mars. Having the capability to manufacture breathable air from local resources will also compensate for air losses due to airlock cycling, atmosphere scrubbing and other causes.</p>

<p>The DRA proposes extracting N2 from the Martian atmosphere for use as a buffer gas. However, it is much cheaper and easier to use the gas that remains after CO2 and dust is removed from Martian air, as this is mostly N2 and Ar, and simply scrub out any undesirable constituents such as O3, NO and CO. Ar, which represents 1% of air on Earth, is non-toxic, unreactive, and a perfectly practical buffer gas; therefore, there&#39;s no practical reason to invest the energy necessary to separate it from N2.</p>

<p>The ISAP process:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Mars atmosphere is drawn into the system through a dust filter.</p>

	<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Water is removed from the gas mix using a WAVAR. The captured water is stored in the Surface Hab&rsquo;s water tank and used to replace recycling losses, and for O2 production via RWGS.</p>

	<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Water is separated into H2 and O2 using electrolysis. The O2 is stored for habitat atmosphere.</p>

	<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> A carbon dioxide freezer is used to separate CO2 (about 96%) from the remainder of the gas mix.</p>

	<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> The CO2 is reacted with H2 via the RWGS reaction:</p>

	<p>CO2 + H2 &rarr; CO + H2O</p>

	<p>The H2O produced is returned to the water tank, and the CO may be stored for use in fuel cells, or, if not needed, it may be vented to the external atmosphere.</p>

	<p>The gas mix that remains after CO2 is removed is mostly N2 and Ar, with trace amounts of various noble gases such as neon, xenon and krypton (which are inert and non-toxic), and some undesirables such as O3, CO, and NO (NO is technically non-toxic, but rapidly oxidises to toxic NO2 when mixed with O2).</p>

	<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> This gas mixture is passed through an ozone scrubber, which reduces the O3 to O2.</p>

	<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> The resultant gas mixture is then passed through an ordinary automobile 3-way catalytic converter, which converts any CO and NO into CO2 and N2.</p>

	<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> The result is a safe buffer gas comprised mostly of N2 and Ar, with small amounts of O2 and CO2, and traces of inert noble gases. This mixture can be combined with additional O2 to provide breathing gas for the Surface Hab. The CO2 level in this gas mixture is slightly higher than the proposed upper limit for the habitat atmosphere, but this excess will be removed by the ECLSS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>More research needs to be done into this system. It is necessary to determine the rate at which breathing gas can be manufactured, how much the unit will weigh, its volume and power requirements, and how it will integrate with the ECLSS.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Maintenance of atmosphere pressures</h2>

<p>The atmospheric pressure in the Transit and Surface Habs and Rover will reduce over time due to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<p>Purging of waste gases (e.g. CO2).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Leaks. Although designed for zero leaks, in practice some small leaks are possible.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Experiments.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Airlock cycling, for the Surface Hab and Rover.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Refilling of marssuit and Rover tanks from the Surface Hab&rsquo;s supply.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Pressure loss is managed in the same way as on the ISS. Oxygen and buffer gas are kept in separate tanks so that both the partial pressure of oxygen and the total atmospheric pressure can be precisely controlled. If the partial pressure of O2 falls below a given threshold, then O2 is replenished from tanks. However, if the total pressure falls below a given threshold, buffer gas is added. The ECLSS controls concentrations of CO2, H2O and contaminants such as CH4, NH3 and others.</p>
