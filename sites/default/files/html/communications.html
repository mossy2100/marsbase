<h2>Between Earth and <em>Adeona</em></h2>

<p><i>Adeona</i> will be equipped with deep space communications equipment. During both the outbound and return journeys, Earth and Mars will be on the same side as the Sun, and therefore line-of-sight radio communications between Earth will be <i>Adeona</i> is possible.</p>

<p>When <i>Adeona</i> is below 3,000km altitude, communications between the spacecraft and Earth can be provided by the SN (Space Network), which provides 100% coverage up to this altitude. The SN is comprised of the geosynchronous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracking_and_Data_Relay_Satellite" style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 20.006303787231445px;" target="_blank">TDRSS</a> (Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System) in addition to various ground-based stations.</p>

<p>When <i>Adeona</i> is above 30,000km altitude, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Space_Network" style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 20.006303787231445px;" target="_blank">DSN</a> (Deep Space Network), comprised of large radio antennas in California, Spain and Australia, can provide a continuous communications link between the spacecraft and Earth.</p>

<p><i>Adeona</i> should only be between 3,000km and 30,000km altitude for short periods, after the TMI and EOI burns. During this time, when neither SN nor DSN can provide 100% coverage by themselves, it may be that the burns are timed such that communications can be provided by either the SN or DSN or both working together, or that communications are provided by other space communications systems such as the Russian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luch_(satellite)" style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 20.006303787231445px;" target="_blank">Luch</a> satellites.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Between Earth and IMRS</h2>

<p>The DSN can provide communications services between the base and Earth. However, there is not always a direct line of sight between Earth and the IMRS, for two reasons:</p>

<p><b>1. Mars is rotating, therefore, about 50% of the time Mars is between Earth and the IMRS.</b></p>

<p>To solve this problem we can take the same approach currently used by robots on the surface of Mars, which communicate with Earth by relaying messages through orbiters like the <i>2001 Mars Odyssey</i>, the <i>Mars Global Surveyor</i> and the <i>Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter</i>. These are closer to the rovers than Earth, which means that the rovers don&rsquo;t need to generate as powerful a signal; also, the orbiters are in sight of Earth for much longer periods of time.</p>

<p>Although this would support communications with IMRS for part of the time, there would also be times when no orbiters will be visible from the base, which would interrupt communications with Earth. While this may be tolerable with robots, it would no doubt be frustrating for crews on Mars as well as Mission Control, friends, family and the media back on Earth. It could also be dangerous in an emergency.</p>

<p>In addition, the bandwidth provided by existing orbiters is presumably far less than what will be required by the IMRS, which will need to be capable of carrying streaming video and common internet services in addition to radio communications.</p>

<p><b>2. Sometimes the Sun is between Earth and Mars.</b></p>

<p>When the Sun is between Earth and Mars (a configuration called <i>solar conjunction</i>), for about two weeks out of every 26 months (the Earth-Mars synodic cycle) thermal noise effectively blocks communications between the two planets. This would only occur once during the surface mission, which may be acceptable. It&rsquo;s a condition that is currently tolerated with Mars rovers, although, again, this would be much less desirable with a human crew.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><i>Mars One</i></h3>

<p>The solution planned by <i>Mars One</i> to provide almost 100% connectivity between Earth and the <i>Mars One</i> settlement is based on two communications satellites:</p>

<ol>
	<li>An areostationary* satellite above the base, which functions as a communications relay during the Martian night.</li>
	<li>A satellite at Earth&rsquo;s L5 Lagrangian point (i.e. sharing Earth&rsquo;s orbit, but trailing by 60&deg;), which serves to relay communications around the Sun during solar conjunction.</li>
</ol>

<p>As this is quite a good solution, requiring only a minimal number of satellites to provide almost 100% connection, it is suggested that IMRS copy it. The two satellites are referred to in this document as <b>MCOS</b> (Mars Communication and Observation Satellite) and <b>L5RS</b> (Lagrange point 5 Relay Satellite). Perhaps, if <i>Mars One</i> is successful, their satellites could be shared with IMRS, or vice versa.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><b>MCOS (Mars Communication and Observation Satellite)</b></h3>

<p>The plan is to place a dedicated satellite in an areostationary orbit, which is a circular orbit with an altitude of 17,033km above Mars&rsquo; equator, at the same longitude as IMRS. When IMRS is on the side of Mars turned away from the Sun, and the line of sight to Earth is blocked by Mars itself, communications can be relayed by MCOS. Because of the high altitude of the satellite (5 times the radius of Mars), and the inclination of Mars&rsquo; axis, this capability enables a communications link between IMRS and Earth about 99% of the time other than at solar conjunction.</p>

<p>One of the advantages of using an areostationary orbit is that MCOS can also provide continuous observation of IMRS, which will be invaluable for MCC and media back on Earth. The view won&rsquo;t be straight down onto the base because MCOS will be above the equator, whereas IMRS is more likely to be located between about 30&deg;N and 60&deg;N, for a variety of reasons (see the section on <i>Location</i>). If IMRS is located at latitude of 45&deg;N, the view from MCOS will be at an angle of about 53&deg;. This is still a pretty useful viewing angle.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure><a class="colorbox" href="/sites/default/files/images/MCOS-pos.png" title="Viewing angle of IMRS from MCOS"><img alt="Viewing angle of IMRS from MCOS" src="/sites/default/files/images/MCOS-pos_0.png" style="width: 300px; height: 113px;" title="Click to embiggen" /></a><figcaption>Viewing angle of IMRS from MCOS</figcaption></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>MCOS will include a high resolution colour camera comparable or superior to HiRISE, thereby providing the capability for MCC to monitor the base from orbit. This would be especially important in case of emergency, or as a potential backup if voice communications with the base malfunctions. Such a camera may be either cheaper or technologically superior to the $40M HiRISE camera, or both, due to evolution in CCD and other relevant technology.</p>

<p>MCOS will ideally also provide real-time HD video from space. Current efforts by <a href="http://www.urthecast.com/" target="_blank">UrtheCast</a> to provide live HD video of Earth from the ISS will be instructive in the design of such a system.</p>

<p>With at least two cameras available, MCOS will be usable for more than simply observation of the base. It can be used for studying almost one entire side of Mars.</p>

<p>The potential for an areostationary communications satellite is yet another advantage of the &ldquo;base-first&rdquo; strategy, as this would not be practical if each mission was to a completely different location. However, with a plan to build up a base at a single location, it makes perfect sense. Having said that, with continuous visibility of almost 42% of the planet the MCOS could potentially serve multiple missions or bases on the same side of Mars.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><b>L5RS (Lagrange point 5 Relay Satellite)</b></h3>

<p>The function of the L5RS is simply to relay communications between Mars and Earth during solar conjunction. Because the Sun blocks communications between Earth and Mars for only two weeks out of every 26 months, this satellite is less critical and may perhaps be considered optional. The first few missions could probably operate perfectly well without it, if it&rsquo;s preferable, for budgetary reasons, to defer the expense of installing that satellite.</p>

<p>If it is installed, however, it may be of use to many other future missions to Mars, since they all have this same problem. In fact, the L5RS will benefit any other deep space missions as well, since the issue also exists for any other planets. When not being used to support Mars missions, L5RS may be used by other deep space missions similarly disrupted by the Sun coming between the spacecraft and Earth.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><b>Bandwidth and internet</b></h3>

<p>The communications system between Earth and IMRS will ideally provide sufficient bandwidth for one channel of streaming video from the satellite itself, plus at least one more from the surface of Mars. It will also support standard internet services such as upload/download of multimedia and other files, email, web-browsing, and software updates for computer systems at the base.</p>

<p>Although the communications system will carry typical internet services, it will not use TCP/IP - the protocols used for most internet services on Earth. All the satellites, spacecraft, habitats, vehicles and spacesuits involved in the mission will use BP (Bundle Protocol) developed for DTN (Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking). This is an alternative internet protocol developed for situations where delays and disruptions to communications are expected, such as space missions. One of the functions of the ISS has been to develop and improve this technology.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Between Hab and Rover</h2>

<p>The Hab and Rover should rarely (if ever) be out of radio comms, especially since the plan is to locate the base in a fairly flat location. If the Rover does go out of radio contact with the Hab, communications may be relayed between the two via MCOS. Another option is to install transponders around the base, particularly at high places, which can function as an LPS as well as communications relays.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Between astronauts and Hab/Rover during EHA/EVA</h2>

<p>Astronauts on EHA/EVA will always maintain radio contact with either the Rover or Hab or, ideally, both. In the rare case that this rule needs to be broken - for example, while exploring a lava tube or cave - then the pair or group (assuming that the crew always work in groups of 2-3) must remain within radio contact of each other at all times, with at least one of them in radio contact with the Hab or Rover.</p>
