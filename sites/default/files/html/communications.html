<h2>Between Earth and <em>Adeona</em></h2>

<p><em>Adeona</em> will be equipped with deep space communications equipment. During both the outbound and return journeys, Earth and Mars will be on the same side as the Sun, and therefore line-of-sight communications between Earth and <em>Adeona</em> is possible.</p>

<p>When <em>Adeona</em> is below 3,000km altitude communications between the spacecraft and Earth can be provided by the Space Network (SN), which provides 100% coverage up to this altitude. The SN is comprised of the geosynchronous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracking_and_Data_Relay_Satellite" target="_blank">TDRSS</a> in addition to various ground-based stations.</p>

<p>When <em>Adeona</em> is above 30,000km altitude, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Space_Network" target="_blank">DSN</a> (Deep Space Network), comprised of large antennas in California, Spain and Australia, can maintain a continuous connection between the spacecraft and Earth.</p>

<p>In theory, <em>Adeona</em> should only be between 3,000km and 30,000km altitude for short periods, after the TMI and EOI burns. During this time, when neither SN nor DSN can provide 100% coverage by themselves, it may be that the burns are timed such that communications can be provided by either the SM or DSN or both working together, or that communications can be supported by other space communications systems, such as the Russian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luch_(satellite)" target="_blank">Luch</a> satellites, or that, if the spaceship is out of communications range for any period of time, this period be very brief.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Between Earth and IMRS</h2>

<p>The DSN can provide communications services between the base and Earth. However, there is not always a direct line of sight between Earth and the IMRS, for two reasons:</p>

<h3>1. Mars is rotating, therefore, about 50% of the time Mars is between Earth and the IMRS.</h3>

<p>To solve this problem we can take the same approach currently used by robots on the surface of Mars, which communicate with Earth primarily by relaying messages through orbiters like the 2001 Mars Odyssey, the Mars Global Surveyor and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. These are closer to the rovers than Earth, which means that the rovers don&rsquo;t need to generate as powerful a signal; also, the orbiters are in sight of Earth for much longer periods of time.</p>

<p>However, there are times when no orbiters will be visible from the base, which would interrupt communications with Earth. This would no doubt be frustrating for crews on Mars as well as Mission Control, friends, family and the media back on Earth, especially in an emergency. In addition, the bandwidth provided by existing orbiters are presumably far less than what will be wanted for the IMRS, which should be capable of providing two channels of streaming video from Mars, as well as internet services for the crew.</p>

<h3>2. Sometimes the Sun is between Earth and Mars.</h3>

<p>When the Sun is between Earth and Mars (a configuration called solar conjunction), for about two weeks out of every Earth-Mars synodic cycle (26 months) thermal noise effectively blocks communications between the two planets. This will only occur once during the a single Mars surface mission (a &ldquo;season&rdquo;), which may be acceptable. It&rsquo;s a condition that is currently tolerated with Mars rovers, although less desirable with a human crew.</p>

<h3>Mars One</h3>

<p>The solution planned by <a href="http://www.mars-one.com/" target="_blank">Mars One</a> [WIELDERS] to provide almost 100% connectivity between Earth and the Mars One settlement is a very good one, and uses two communications satellites:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		<p>An areostationary satellite above the base, which functions as a communications relay during the Martian night.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><span>A satellite at Earth&rsquo;s L5 Lagrangian point (i.e. sharing Earth&rsquo;s orbit, but trailing by 60&deg;), which serves to relay communications around the Sun during solar conjunction.</span></p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>This is the solution adopted in this architecture, where they are referred to as MCOS and L5RS. It is quite possible that, if Mars One is successful, their satellites could also be used by IMRS, or vice versa.</p>

<h3>MCOS (Mars Communication and Observation Satellite)</h3>

<p>The plan is to place a dedicated satellite in an areostationary orbit above the base. This is an equatorial orbit with an altitude of 17,033km and the same longitude as the base. The proposed satellite is named MCOS, and will be able to provide a communications link between IMRS and Earth almost 100% of the time (except for solar conjunction). It will also provide continuous observation of the base, which will be invaluable for Mission Control and media back on Earth.</p>

<p>The potential for an areostationary communications satellite is yet another advantage of the base-first strategy, as this would not be practical if each mission is to a different location. However, by building up a base at a single location and establishing a permanent human presence at that location, it makes sense.</p>

<p>MCOS will provide bandwidth sufficient to for one channel of streaming video from the satellite itself, at least one other from the surface of Mars (although naturally multiple video streams from Mars will be preferable), in addition to typical internet services such as upload/download of multimedia and other files, email, web-browsing, and software updates for computer systems at the base.</p>

<p>Although MCOS will provide the base with typical internet services, it will not use TCP/IP, the protocols used for most internet services on Earth. All the satellites, spacecraft, habitats, vehicles and spacesuits involved in the mission will use BP (Bundle Protocol) developed for DTN (Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking). This is an alternative internet protocol suited to situations where delays and disruptions to communications are expected, such as space missions. One of the functions of the ISS has been to develop and improve this technology.</p>

<p>MCOS would include a high resolution colour camera comparable to HiRISE, thereby providing the capability for MCC to monitor the base from orbit. This would be especially important in case of emergency, or as a potential backup if the communication link breaks. Such a camera may be either cheaper or technologically superior to the $40M HiRISE camera due to evolution in CCD and other relevant technology.</p>

<p>MCOS will also provide real-time HD video from space. Current efforts by <a href="http://www.urthecast.com/" target="_blank">UrtheCast</a> to provide live HD video of Earth from the ISS will be instructive in the design of such a system.</p>

<h3>L5RS (Lagrangian point 5 Relay Satellite)</h3>

<p>This is the less critical of the two satellites, and may perhaps be considered optional. The cost of not installing the L5RS will be that Earth-Mars communications will be interrupted by the Sun for approximately two weeks out of every 26 months, as now. This is probably acceptable. However, if this satellite is installed, it will benefit not only the IMRS but all deep space missions.</p>

<p>The function of the L5RS will simply be to relay communications between Mars and Earth during solar conjunction. At other times it may be used for other purposes, such as to support other deep space missions that may be similarly disrupted when the Sun comes between the spacecraft and Earth.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Between Hab and Rover</h2>

<p>The Hab and Rover will rarely (if ever) be out of radio comms, especially since the plan is to locate the base in a fairly flat location. If the Rover does go out of radio contact with the Hab, communications may be relayed between the two via MCOS. Another option is to install transponders around the base, particularly at high points, which can function as an LPS as well as communications relays.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Between astronauts and Hab/Rover during EHA/EVA</h2>

<p>Astronauts on EHA/EVA will always maintain radio contact with either the Rover or Hab or, ideally, both. In the rare case that this rule needs to be broken - for example, exploring a lava tube or cave - then the pair or group (remembering that the crew always work in groups of 2-3) must remain within radio contact of each other at all times, with at least one in radio contact with the Hab or Rover.</p>
