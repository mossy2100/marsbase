<p>One of the primary challenges associated with any Mars mission is the design of power systems.</p>

<p>Energy is needed for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>ECLSS</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lighting</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Refrigeration and cooking (maybe - see section on <a href="/food#powdered-food">Powdered Food</a>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Computing and multimedia</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Communications</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ISRU</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Airlock operation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recharging of marssuit and surface vehicle batteries</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For both space and surface power systems, the primary options under consideration for Mars are nuclear fission and solar. Each have their pros and cons; however, as will be shown, it seems more likely that solar will be preferable for both space and surface power.</p>

<p>Wind energy may be viable for future Mars settlements, but probably not early Mars missions for several reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Because the air pressure on Mars is so low (less than 1% of Earth), it does not generate enough force to produce much electricity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wind turbines operating in such a dusty environment may require high levels of maintenance that would be difficult to provide.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Early Mars missions will probably be located in low altitude areas, for warmth. The air may be thicker, but the wind will be slower. Wind turbines on Mars may perform better at high altitudes.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Areothermal energy sources are a future possibility, but are yet to be proven or located, and will probably be inaccessible to early explorers. More information about areothermal energy is provided in the <a href="/location">Location</a> section.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>ECLSS</h2>

<h3>Thermal control</h3>

<p>Maintaining a comfortable environment inside <em>Adeona</em> and the Surface Hab represents a significant power requirement.</p>

<p>In <em>Adeona</em>, as in the ISS, the primary requirement will be cooling. On the ISS:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The large amount of electrical power consumed by the station&#39;s systems and experiments is turned almost entirely into heat. The heat which can be dissipated through the walls of the stations modules is insufficient to keep the internal ambient temperature within comfortable, workable limits. Ammonia is continuously pumped through pipework throughout the station to collect heat, and then into external radiators exposed to the cold of space, and back into the station.</em> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station" target="_blank">Wikipedia/International Space Station</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A similar approach may be suitable for <em>Adeona</em>, however, appropriate solutions may have already been developed for the BA 330 (details of the ECLSS in the BA 330 are currently unavailable). If not, solutions can be adapted from the ISS. The thermal environment of interplanetary space is similar to that in LEO, although it will become cooler farther from the Sun, reducing the load on thermal control systems.</p>

<p>Although the priority in <em>Adeona</em> will be cooling, in the Hab the primary requirement may be heating. The desired temperature for the internal environment of the Hab will be approximately 295K (22&deg;C). This is, on average, around 80K warmer than the external environment of Mars, although the temperature of the Martian surface can vary from 130K (winter at the poles) to 308K (summer at the equator). The base will not reach these extremes, however, considering that electrical subsystems inside the Surface Hab will also produce heat, and the first surface mission takes place during the three warmest seasons in the northern hemisphere, it&rsquo;s likely that cooling will also be required at times. Therefore, the Surface Hab will require both heating and cooling subsystems, which may be derived from ISS or Apollo (or other space habitat) systems or may be completely new and developed specifically for the unique Martian environment.</p>

<p>To reduce the power required for heating the Surface Hab we can choose a warmer-than-average location. This is discussed in the <a href="/location">Location</a> section.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Ventilation</h3>

<p>Because warm air does not rise in &micro;g, ventilation is an issue on the ISS, as it will also be on <em>Adeona</em>. Air around laptop computers, for example, can heat up considerably. Maintaining a consistent air flow through the ISS via the use of fans is essential.</p>

<p>Again, it remains to be seen what provisions are made for ventilation in the BA 330&rsquo;s built-in ECLSS. However, it&rsquo;s likely that additional fans will be needed near computers and other electrical equipment installed in <em>Adeona</em>.</p>

<p>Within the Hab, even though it will be operating in a gravity environment, ventilation will still be important. Any volume can produce hot and cold spots if air circulation is inadequate. Effective circulation is especially important in an enclosed environment to ensure that accumulated carbon dioxide or ammonia in the atmosphere is effectively scrubbed by the ECLSS.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Options for Energy</h2>

<h3>Nuclear</h3>

<p>Nuclear energy has some clear benefits, namely that it can provide an abundant power supply day and night, irrespective of weather or location. A fission reactor could provide ample power for ISRU processes and other electrical subsystems. Furthermore, they do not require energy storage solutions.</p>

<p>In the original plan for Mars Direct, the ERV includes a nuclear reactor to provide energy to the ISPP system. This enables propellant production to occur rapidly, thus ensuring that the hydrogen brought from Earth is converted to methane as quickly as possible to minimise hydrogen boil-off and ensures that sufficient fuel will be manufactured.</p>

<p>Once the ERV lands on Mars, a small robotic truck emerges with an nuclear reactor. The truck carries the reactor some way off, trailing electrical cable connecting it to the MAV. The reason why it must be distanced from the MAV is because the reactor will be unshielded.</p>

<p>On Earth nuclear reactors are normally heavily shielded and encased in multiple containment shells in case of an accident. However, due to the high mass of shielding material, it isn&rsquo;t practical to send such shielding and protective shells to Mars. Shielding is typically very heavy, which would make it even harder to land the already-heavy MAV on Mars.</p>

<p>However, the MAV is designed to carry people. If an unshielded reactor is operated inside or near the MAV, it would irradiate the vehicle, making it unsafe. Therefore, the unshielded nuclear reactor must be transported some distance from the Hab, and ideally hidden in a depression or behind a hill or crater wall, in order to prevent radiation products from reaching the crew or any other part of the base.</p>

<p>There are some problems with this strategy. If the reactor is unshielded, even if it&rsquo;s moved some distance away from the MAV, it would create a zone around it that would be unsafe for the crew. The MAV may not be affected by radiation from the reactor, but the natural environment surrounding the reactor will be.</p>

<p>In this mission planner's opinion we should treat Mars a little more responsibly than this. What if the reactor is parked near something of scientific interest? What if it needs attention for some reason? What is the long term plan for decommissioning the reactor? Many people who are not advocates of Mars settlement say things like &ldquo;we messed up one planet already, should we be messing up another?&rdquo; If we act in such an environmentally irresponsible way, operating an unshielded nuclear reactor on Mars, then such criticism would be justified.</p>

<p>That does not mean fission should be completely ruled out as a power source. There are several new types of reactor currently in development that do not have many of the problems associated with the existing generation of reactors. Future fission reactors, with appropriate shielding, may be appropriate.</p>

<p>However, there is a significant problem with <em>any</em> fission reactors on Mars: in the event of an accident, malfunction, or even routine maintenance, which will surely be more likely and frequent in the unfamiliar and challenging environment of Mars, access to the reactor is made considerably more difficult by the Martian environment, and there may not even be people around to do it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>LFTR&rsquo;s</h4>

<p>One of the most promising new reactor types is the LFTR (pronounced &ldquo;lifter&rdquo;). These reactors are fuelled by thorium, a far cheaper and more abundant fuel than uranium. Mars has plenty of thorium:</p>

<figure><a class="colorbox" href="/sites/default/files/images/thorium-map.jpg" title="Thorium distribution on Mars"><img alt="Thorium distribution on Mars" src="/sites/default/files/images/thorium-map_0.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 138px;" title="Click to embiggen" /></a>

  <figcaption>Thorium distribution on Mars</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>LFTR&rsquo;s produce much less waste, can utilise existing nuclear waste as fuel, operate at much lower pressures, cannot melt down or explode, and the reactors can be of a much smaller scale. These features are ideal for space applications. Yet LFTR&rsquo;s obviously retain the primary benefit of nuclear fission reactors in that they can provide an always-on, reliable, abundant source of energy.</p>

<p>LFTR&rsquo;s are still in development and it may be decades before they are in commercial use. If viable, perhaps they could be developed for Mars. For now we must consider alternatives.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Solar</h3>

<p>Are solar panels a reliable energy source on Mars? Along with many other Mars and space missions, the Mars Exploration Rovers <em>Spirit</em> and <em>Opportunity</em> were powered by solar energy. <em>Spirit</em> was active for six years, and <em>Opportunity</em> is still going after almost 10 years at the time of writing. Solar has been shown to be a practical energy source on Mars. Research has shown the modern solar technology can match the mass and volume performance of nuclear energy on Mars, and because of safety, environmental and policy issues, is likely to be preferred (Cooper et al., 2010).</p>

<p>A simple comparison of solar and nuclear, using our hardware cost variables:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The primary problem with solar panels is that they represent a fluctuating energy source that varies with the diurnal cycle, seasonal cycle, and atmospheric dust levels. As a rule of thumb, daytime solar energy on Mars is about half that of Earth (the solar intensity at the upper atmosphere is 43% of Earth&rsquo;s, but Mars has no clouds). Furthermore, dust can accumulate on panels, reducing their effectiveness, although with a human crew present this problem can be addressed reasonably easily with conventional broom technology.</p>

<p>Solar energy is currently one of the largest areas of investment on Earth, and the technology is advancing rapidly. In 2011 investment in solar peaked at about $157 billion. Investment in rooftop solar peaked in 2012 at about $80 billion.</p>

<p>One of the most important developments in recent years is the use of CIGS (copper indium gallium diselenide) as an alternative substrate for thin film solar cells. This material permits:

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>printable solar material</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>greater efficiency at converting solar energy to electrical energy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>greater precision and consistency with solar cell manufacture, which significantly reduces efficiency losses</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>flexible solar panels that can be transported in rolls</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It seems very likely that by the 2030&rsquo;s solar will be a mainstream energy production technology on Earth, and will be entirely suitable for Mars missions, with numerous advantages over nuclear. A spacecraft (e.g. a Red Dragon capsule or a MAV) could bring a roll of flexible CIGS solar cells from Earth, and robotically unroll these onto the surface of Mars to collect solar energy in an efficient and simple manner.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Solar energy for <em>Athena</em></h4>

<p>One of the reasons for the ERV&rsquo;s nuclear reactor in the Mars Direct architecture is that propellant production can proceed quickly, day and night, in order to minimise hydrogen boil-off and ensure that all the propellant gets made. However, if we commit to using local water as a hydrogen source, hydrogen does not need to be stored, since hydrogen produced by electrolysis of water can be immediately converted to methane. Thus there will be no boil-off and less urgency to manufacture the propellant as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>We therefore don&rsquo;t need an uninterrupted power supply for ISPP, which means we can use solar energy for ISPP, which is much safer, and simply manufacture propellant only during the daytime when power is available.</p>

<p>We have about 20 months between when <em>Athena</em> arrives at Mars and when the crew leaves Earth at the subsequent launch opportunity. Even if propellant is only being made during the day, this should still be plenty of time to ensure that <em>Athena</em> is fully fuelled before the crew leave Earth. In fact, there is about 44 months between <em>Athena</em>&rsquo;s arrival and departure (26 between the arrival of <em>Athena</em> and the arrival of the crew, plus 18 months of surface mission), so extra time is available if required.</p>

<p>By using solar panels instead of a nuclear fission reactor for ISPP power, we eliminate the mass of the reactor, the robotic truck to relocate it, and the electrical cable that would connect the reactor to the MAV. We eliminate the risk of an unshielded reactor irradiating the MAV, the surrounding terrain, or the crew, and generally polluting the pristine Martian environment.</p>

<p>The Dragon&rsquo;s trunk is already designed to contain solar panels. These may perhaps be used to provide some of the power necessary for ISPP (or the trunk may be removed, or it may be reserved for samples and left empty to reduce landed mass). The MAV&rsquo;s ascent stage may potentially include additional panels. However, perhaps the best approach is to include a roll of solar fabric in the lower section of the MAV, on a fixed roller, which the multi-purpose AWESOM robot can unroll simply by dragging one end away from the MAV. Another option would be for the outer walls of the descent stage to open up like a flower, revealing solar panels on their inner surfaces. Yet another option would be for some of the outer surfaces of <em>Athena</em> to be coated in a photovoltaic material or coating. Calculations need to be done to determine precisely what area of PV cells (whether panels, fabric or coating) is required to produce the necessary power, plus a suitable margin. This will, of course, depend on the efficiency of the PV material available at the time of the mission.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Solar energy for the Hab</h4>

<p>Although we don&rsquo;t need an uninterrupted power supply for propellant production, this is a requirement for the Hab because the ECLSS (at least) must operate continuously.</p>

<p>In order to solve the issue of variability of power supply from solar panels, an energy storage solution is required, whereby some percentage of the solar energy collected each day is stored for use during the night. However, due to efficiency losses in energy storage, as well as limits on how much energy can be stored given the mass of batteries (or fuel cells, or other storage solution) that can be affordably be transported to Mars, it&rsquo;s important to minimise the amount of energy to be provided from storage.</p>

<p>Energy required by the Hab during the Martian night, when no solar power is available and the Hab is reliant on stored energy, can be much lower than during the day if we implement a simple rule that the crew sleeps or at least rests while it&rsquo;s dark, i.e. wake at dawn each day and do all work in daylight hours. This minimises the use of power for lighting, and restricts primary power consumption by activities such as computing, communications, laboratory experiments, etc. to the daytime when solar power is directly available.</p>

<p>The main Hab subsystems requiring power during the night will be ECLSS and comms. The nights are naturally colder, so energy requirements for heating will be higher than during the day.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Energy storage</h4>

<p>There are several options for storage of solar energy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>As H2, CO, CH4, CH3OH or other fuel, for use in a fuel cell.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Batteries.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Graphene supercapacitors.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Batteries are preferred over fuel cells for several reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Battery technology is evolving quickly due to the expansion of the electric vehicle market. The downside of batteries is that they tend to be heavy, but the amount of energy stored per unit mass, or per unit volume, is steadily decreasing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Batteries are mechanically very simple, require minimal maintenance and are more reliable. Fuel cells are more complex, and can break more easily.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Graphene supercapacitors are a technology currently in development that could well be available by 2030, and are far superior to batteries. They can store much more charge per unit volume or mass, and they recharge extremely quickly. For this reason they&rsquo;re receiving considerable interest at this time due to their potential for use in electric cars and electronics, and are likely to evolve rapidly in the next couple of decades leading up to the first H2M missions. Another advantage of graphene supercapacitors that could become more important in the future is that they&rsquo;re made of pure carbon, which means, we can make them on Mars from the atmosphere.</p>
