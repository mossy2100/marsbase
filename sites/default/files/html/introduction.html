<p>Many H2M (Humans-to-Mars) architectures have been proposed over the years, with each new iteration incorporating innovations and technologies, filling gaps and solving problems, and bringing us step-by-step closer to the goal of sending people to the red planet. It is now widely believed within the Mars community that there remain few, if any, genuine technological barriers to sending humans to Mars, and almost all elements required for a successful mission are now available either from commercial suppliers, or are being, or could be, developed by government space agencies. Although some crucial mission components still need to be developed, the primary challenges are now arguably financial and political rather than technological.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important and disruptive architecture presented in recent years was Mars Direct [ZUBRIN], principally because it introduced the idea of ISPP (In Situ Propellant Production) as a method for drastically reducing the mass transported to Mars and therefore the investment required for a successful H2M mission. This represented a quantum leap forward in H2M mission concepts, reducing the estimated total cost by approximately a factor of eight.</p>

<p>In 1995 NASA began developing a new Mars mission architecture, known as the <em>NASA Design Reference Mission</em> [HOFFMAN], which incorporated elements of Mars Direct, including ISPP. This architecture has evolved to version 5.0, and is now called the <em>Design Reference Architecture</em> (DRA) [DRAKE2]. The DRA has been in development for at least 12 years, involving many experts and departments within NASA, and undoubtedly represents one of the best H2M architectures currently available.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, a variety of modifications to the DRA have since been proposed, suggesting further opportunities for improving the architecture:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<p>Adopting a base-first approach rather than a series of missions to disparate locations [GAGE].</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>The use of biconic spacecraft to improve EDL (Entry, Descent and Landing) performance and to more efficiently optimise spacecraft and habitat geometry [WILLSON].</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>The use of MLLV (Medium Lift Launch Vehicles) or EELV (Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicles) to eliminate the significant investment required to develop a suitable HLLV (Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle) [BONIN].</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>The use of inflatable modules to significantly expand habitat volume [KOZICKI].</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>The use of capsules to safely deliver cargo and crew [WIELDERS].</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>The Blue Dragon architecture is largely based on the DRA, but incorporates a number of changes, inspired in part by ideas such as those listed above. Blue Dragon takes advantage of a number of COTS hardware components that have recently become or will soon become available, thus drastically reducing the estimated cost of sending people to Mars. The result is an affordable and achievable architecture that offers increased safety and reliability, and improved outcomes.</p>

<p>The mission is named &ldquo;Blue Dragon&rdquo; because it makes use of Dragon capsules from Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX) for transporting crew and cargo to and from Mars. The name is inspired by the &quot;Red Dragon&quot; landing system currently being developed for landing payloads on Mars using Dragon capsules. It&rsquo;s &ldquo;blue&rdquo; because the blue planet is linking with the red planet, or because we're bringing water and oxygen to Mars.</p>

<p>Two related concepts for precursor missions currently in development are &ldquo;Green Dragon&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gold Dragon&rdquo;, both designed to test mission-critical elements of the Blue Dragon architecture. These missions are described briefly towards the end of this document, and in more detail separately.</p>

<p>Aside from architectural changes, there are two other important differences from the DRA, related to the intention of the mission.</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		<p>Blue Dragon and the IMRS are designed as the initiation of a process of settlement. The focus is less on &ldquo;flags and footprints&rdquo;, or scientific exploration for its own sake. The primary emphasis is on laying the foundations for a permanent human presence: making use of local resources, building up technological infrastructure, studying effects on human physiology and psychology, and generally learning how to live on Mars. The fundamental philosophy here is to develop a permanent presence first, then we can do as much science as we want, much more easily, cheaply, efficiently and conveniently.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>The intention is that Blue Dragon be implemented as an international collaborative effort. If Mars is to be a future home for humanity, it must be for <em>all</em> humanity, and not any single Earthian nation. To become multiplanetary, we must leave nationalistic ideas behind and approach Mars as a united people.</p>
