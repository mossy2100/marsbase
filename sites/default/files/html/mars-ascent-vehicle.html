<p>The MAV will be an VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) vehicle capable of pinpoint landing on Mars, refuelling from local Martian resources, and carrying up six astronauts to Mars orbit. The MAV design currently described in this section uses local Martian water for propellant production; however, note the possibility remains that we will need to bring hydrogen from Earth instead. The first MAV is named <em>Athena</em>.</p>

<p>The MAV has three stages:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		<p>The lower section is the descent stage, which includes:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>Descent engines and fuel tanks</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>A sophisticated GNC system</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>One or more rolls of PV material</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>ISPP plant (electrolysis unit and Sabatier reactor)</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>A water-mining robot called AWESOM (see the section about <a href="/water">Water</a>)</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>The middle section is the ascent stage and includes:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>Ascent engines (e.g. SpaceX Raptor)</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>LOX/LCH4 fuel tanks, which are initially empty</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>The upper section is a modified DragonRider with no heat shield, landing thrusters, fuel tanks or fuel. It will retain its RCS. The trunk may potentially be eliminated, or it may be used for solar panels or sample storage.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>Ascent Engines</h2>

<p>The MAV&rsquo;s ascent stage engines will be LOX/LCH4 (liquid oxygen/liquid methane), which are refuelled from local Martian resources. Several types of engines that burn methane fuel have been developed, however, <a href="http://www.spacex.com/" target="_blank">SpaceX</a> are currently developing a new LOX/LCH4 engine called &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raptor_(rocket_engine)" target="_blank">Raptor</a>&rdquo;, which may become the preferred choice for several reasons.</p>

<p>Based on SpaceX&rsquo;s record, the Raptor design is likely to be more modern and advanced than existing alternatives. It is also likely to have a high degree of interoperability with other SpaceX hardware used in the mission, such as the Dragon. Furthermore, since SpaceX will already be involved, using more hardware from the same company should, in theory, reduce costs, if for no other reasons that a fewer number of engineers need to be paid, since engineers who understand the Dragon and Falcon are also probably the same people who understand the Raptor engine.</p>

<h2>Differences from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Direct" target="_blank">Mars Direct</a>&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Direct#Earth_Return_Vehicle" target="_blank">ERV</a></h2>

<p>The Blue Dragon MAV should be much lighter vehicle than the ERV used in Mars Direct, as it does not include the mass of:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<p>Six tonnes of hydrogen brought from Earth</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Nuclear reactor</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Light robotic truck for relocating reactor</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Electrical cable to connect MAV to reactor</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead, it includes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<p>AWESOM water-mining robot</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>One or more rolls of PV material</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the AWESOM could potentially be delivered separately, in a Red Dragon cargo capsule, in order to reduce landed mass of the MAV.</p>

<p><em>Athena</em>&rsquo;s propellant requirements are lower than for the ERV, being required only for Mars ascent and not TEI (same as for the MAV in the DRA). Less propellant means smaller fuel tanks (and therefore lower mass), and less time required for the manufacture of propellant.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also no need for RWGS or dissociation of CO2 to produce additional O2, as ample is obtained from water electrolysis. This simplifies the design of the ISPP unit, which can therefore be made smaller and lighter.</p>
