<p>The MTV is constructed on Earth orbit. It&rsquo;s designed to support a crew of six in a &micro;g (microgravity) environment for the trip from Earth to Mars and back. It will only be used in space, and will not land on, or launch from, any planetary surface.</p>

<p>The MTV is a spaceship, and ships should have a more interesting name than &ldquo;MTV&rdquo;. The first MTV is therefore named &ldquo;<em>Adeona</em>&rdquo;, the Roman goddess of safe return. It comes from the Latin verb adeo, &ldquo;to approach or visit&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;to take possession of one&rsquo;s inheritance&rdquo;. Mars is our inheritance and we hope for a safe return for the crew.</p>

<p><em>Adeona</em> is comprised of a BA 330-DS, which is called the Transit Hab, plus a cruise stage.</p>

<h2>Cruise stage</h2>

<p>Attached to the BA 330 is a cruise stage comprised of engines, fuel tanks, RCS, navigation and deep space communications equipment. Although GNC systems are built into the BA 330, additional GNC systems suited to interplanetary travel may also be incorporated into the cruise stage(s).</p>

<p>The engines will need to perform four major burns:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Trans Mars Injection (TMI) at ~Day 0</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mars Orbit Insertion (MOI) at ~Day 180</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Trans Earth Injection (TEI) at ~Day 720</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Earth Orbit Insertion (EOI) at ~Day 900</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>As <em>Adeona</em> does not refuel until its return to Earth, it must commence the mission with enough fuel for all four burns plus a suitable safety margin. This greatly increases the initial wet mass of <em>Adeona</em>.</p>

<p>The RCS is used at Mars and Earth to circularise/stabilise orbit or increase/decrease altitude as required. Furthermore, on approach to Mars and Earth orbits, the RCS will be used to rotate the spacecraft 180 degrees such that the main engine is pointing towards the planet in preparation for MOI or EOI.</p>

<p>For comparison, the diagram below shows the chemical propulsion version of the MTV proposed in the DRA. The &ldquo;Transit Habitat&rdquo; is similar to a BA 330. Each engine is an <a href="https://www.rocket.com/rl10-engine-0" target="_blank">RL10B-2</a>, a LOX/LH2 rocket engine developed by <a href="https://www.rocket.com/" target="_blank">Aerojet Rocketdyne</a>.</p>

<h2>Earth Orbit Insertion</h2>

<p>The MTV described in the DRA does not have an EOI stage; rather, as the vehicle approaches Earth, the crew transfer to an Orion capsule, undock, and perform a very fast direct entry into Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. Blue Dragon adds an EOI stage so that the vehicle can be captured into Earth orbit. After EOI, a Dragon capsule is launched from Earth, which then docks with the Transit Hab, and the crew transfer to this capsule for EDL. This plan offers several advantages:â€‹</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The deceleration forces experienced by the crew during Earth EDL will be much less when descending from orbit than approaching by direct entry. It is therefore much safer and much less risky and stressful for the crew.</p>
  </li>
  <li><em>Adeona</em> can be refuelled and refurbished on orbit, and reused by subsequent crews, thus saving money and taking advantage of the homely tweaks made to the Transit Hab by previous crews - just like in FMARS and MDRS.</li>
  <li>
    <p>The spacecraft can travel from Mars to Earth without a capsule attached, making it lighter (although, to be fair, it will instead carry additional fuel for EOI).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>LOX/LCH4 for in-space propulsion</h2>

<p>Nuclear thermal propulsion is not used for in-space propulsion; rather, chemical propulsion using LOX/LCH4 is preferred for a variety of reasons.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Commonality of hardware elements. Because LOX/LCH4 is being used for the MAV, if the same basic type of engine is used for the MTV (e.g. a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raptor_(rocket_engine)" target="_blank">SpaceX Raptor</a>), we automatically build redundancy into our knowledge base. Propulsion engineers working on both vehicles will be able to share expertise, resulting in greater synergy and problem-solving capability. It also reduces the number of types of components across the mission.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Methane has various advantages over RP1 (Rocket Propellant 1, i.e. kerosene). It&rsquo;s cheaper, as it can be obtained directly from LNG, has a slightly better specific impulse, and is not subject to coking.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Methane is considerably easier to work with than hydrogen. H2 must be stored cryogenically, requires large tanks, leaks, causes metal to become brittle, and can cause invisible high-temperature fires.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because hydrogen boils off (leaks), an additional margin is required to compensate. Considering that the MTV is in operation for approximately 2.5 years per mission, including waiting on Mars orbit for 1.5 years, the boil-off quantity can be significant. Hydrogen has a very low density and requires large and therefore heavy storage tanks, and the need to store an additional margin to compensate for boil-off increases the necessary tank size yet further.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Chemical propulsion is much safer than nuclear. Due to mass constraints nuclear engines are unshielded and do not come with the multiple layers of protection built into reactors. If there are any problems with the reactor, such as a meltdown, LOC would be highly likely, and nuclear radiation products could enter the atmosphere of Earth or Mars.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cost. Due to the abundance of CH4, CO2 and H2O in the Solar System, and the benefits of ISPP, LOX/LCH4 engines are likely to become more common and less expensive as exploration and settlement of Mars and the wider Solar System proceeds, which will drive costs down.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>No aerobraking/aerocapture</h2>

<p>An important consideration in Mars mission design is the amount of fuel to be carried with the spacecraft. In order to reduce the launched mass, aerobraking or aerocapture is sometimes used at Mars to slow the spacecraft and insert it into a Mars orbit, rather than controlling the spacecraft velocity purely using engines.</p>

<p>Aerobraking can take a very long time, up to six months at Mars, which makes it impractical for crew delivery, although it may be possible for cargo delivery.</p>

<p>Aerocapture is quicker, but the large drag forces can damage solar panels, antennas and other exposed equipment. It also requires a heat shield, and for a spacecraft with a 6.7 metre diameter this would be large and heavy (although an inflatable heat shield may be an option). The would partially or wholly offset the mass of saved fuel.</p>

<p>Aerobraking and aerocapture are also more risky. If the spacecraft hits the atmosphere at a slightly wrong angle, it can skip out and fly right past the planet. Also, due to atmospheric turbulence, variations in temperature, composition, etc., it can be difficult to predict the effects of aerobraking. However, if engines are used to control the spacecraft the effect can be precisely known, and if there are any minor miscalculations, additional small burns can be made to place the spacecraft into the correct, safe orbit.</p>

<p>Therefore, by ensuring we have enough fuel for MOI, and avoiding aerobraking/aerocapture, we gain the following advantages:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>No risk to damage to spacecraft components through interaction with the atmosphere.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No need for a heat shield.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Higher predictability of spacecraft motion.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Higher certainty that the spacecraft will achieve the desired orbit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No need to endanger the crew by attempting a risky manoeuvre with them on board.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The trade-off is additional fuel and a therefore a larger cruise stage.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Artificial gravity is not used (or required)</h2>

<p>DRA does not specify whether AG (Artificial Gravity) should be used, although it does discuss the topic. It states that AG would be far more important for a short-stay, opposition-class mission due to the longer time spent in space.</p>

<p>The use of AG in Blue Dragon would significantly increase the cost of the mission due to additional mass of both spacecraft and fuel, and increased complexity of propulsion, navigation, communications and power systems. It introduces additional hazards and failure modes, and would increase the cost of development as well as operation. It would also compromise the interior design, as a spaceship designed for &micro;g can be made more space efficient.</p>

<p>The benefits of AG don&rsquo;t warrant these sacrifices. We have considerable experience with astronauts spending months in &micro;g. On return to Earth, some are able to walk away from the spacecraft and some are not, but all recover and readapt to Earth gravity in time. On arrival at Mars it&rsquo;s expected that the crew will need a couple of weeks to adapt from &micro;g to Mars gravity, but since they have 18 months on the surface, this comparatively brief recovery period will barely affect the surface mission. The astronauts will be eager for EVA and will push themselves to recover quickly.</p>

<p>The crew of the Blue Dragon mission will spend time each day doing exercise, either in <em>Adeona</em>&rsquo;s small gym or by doing EHA at Mars, to offset deconditioning. They will be administered osteoporosis drugs to mitigate bone loss, and will have a diet high in protein and minerals. Leveraging months of experience in &micro;g on the ISS, modern training principles and equipment, and appropriate nutrition and drugs, the crew should be totally physically able after spending six months in &micro;g. Therefore we can safely spare the considerable additional cost and complexity of implementing AG.</p>

<p>The entrepreneur Dennis Tito is currently developing a mission to send two people on a Mars flyby, which will require them to spend more than 1.5 years in &micro;g. This mission will go a long way towards answering the question of whether it will safe to send a crew to Mars surface and back on a 2.5 year mission. Mars One also does not make use of AG.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Same vehicle for outbound and return</h2>

<p>In Mars Direct the crew fly out in the Hab, and return in the ERV (Earth Return Vehicle). However, in the DRA and Blue Dragon the crew fly out and back in the same vehicle.</p>

<p>It makes sense to use the same vehicle. During the 6-month outbound trip, the crew will make the Transit Hab their home. They&rsquo;ll humanise the space, putting up posters and sticky notes, hooks and loops, photos and knick-knacks, with each person making little tweaks to the environment to suit their individual behaviours and preferences. They&rsquo;ll develop routines that work with the spacecraft, and learn each other&rsquo;s habits and develop protocols for co-habitation in the relatively confined volume. They&rsquo;ll find a whole range of optimisations, and learn the various quirks of the vehicle. The vehicle&rsquo;s server will have all their favourite music, movies, books, games and websites already downloaded. They will fix and improve things - an improvised washing line here, a cable-tie or pencil-holder there.</p>

<p>Spacecraft are designed by engineers, and decorations and personal touches are typically a distant consideration to the primary function of the hardware, namely to keep people alive and carry them safely to their destination. The designers of the Transit Hab interior are unlikely to think of everything six individuals need or want in order to create a comfortable living and working space for one year. By using the same ship for the inbound trip, there will be a sense of familiarity, almost home-coming, when they re-enter <em>Adeona</em> for the inbound journey. Everything will already be prepared, by each crew member, for themselves. This will have a positive effect on morale, and be important for safety. It will mitigate post-Mars depression (as likely as postnatal, post-coital or post-festival depression), and will eliminate the time cost of setting up a return vehicle in much the same way as the outbound vehicle.</p>

<p>In the event that any members of the crew are coming back from Mars sick or injured, having a familiar environment will even be important.</p>

<p>The reason for using the same vehicle for the outbound and return trips goes beyond comfort, however. <em>Adeona</em> is designed specifically for a micro-gravity environment. If the crew fly out to Mars in a Hab, however, it would need to be designed for both gravity and &micro;g environments (assuming no AG), which would naturally require compromises. Furthermore, using a single vehicle for in-space travel simply saves money. The intention is that <em>Adeona</em> can be re-used over and over, refuelled, refurbished and/or upgraded each time it arrives back at Earth.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Reusability</h2>

<p>One of the main reasons for capturing the MTV back into Earth orbit is so we can reuse it. Once back in Earth orbit, <em>Adeona</em> can be refuelled and made ready for another mission. Instead of building a new spacecraft every time, we can refurbish, expand and improve on the one we have. This is obviously cheaper than constructing a new spacecraft each time. We could add on another inflatable module, upgrade the engine, solar panels or computer systems, or make any number of other improvements. We will have the option to run training missions to the spacecraft, operate it as a space station, or use it for a lunar, asteroid or other mission.</p>

<p>Since our intention is to capture the spacecraft into Earth orbit, an EOI burn is required. The additional fuel must be transported to Mars and back, and this will necessitate a larger propulsion stage, which will incur a non-trivial cost. Note that this additional fuel requirement is mitigated by the fact that, in Blue Dragon, <em>Adeona</em> does not have a capsule attached during the return trip, hence the fuel required for TEI is correspondingly lower.</p>

<p>For now it is assumed that, unlike in the DRA, there will be only one cruise, so that no engines are discarded. This means a larger, heavier cruise stage that will cost more to build and launch, as the amount of mass that travels to Mars and back will be greater, necessitating more fuel and larger tanks. However, ultimately this approach is cheaper because the vehicle can be used over and over. It avoids wasting perfectly good engines, thus saving money and producing less space debris, and makes it cheaper, quicker and easier to run the next mission. Imagine the price of the tickets if every airline flight required new engines!</p>

<p>Most importantly, the familiarity of reusing a habitat that has been successfully occupied by previous crews, and which may contain such relics as photographs, flags, signatures, and various user-friendly tweaks to the environment, can have important psychological benefits for a crew and create a powerful feeling of connection with past crews. Subsequent crews can draw inspiration from, and add to, the marks and refinements made by previous ones. This has been demonstrated and enjoyed many times by crews of FMARS and MDRS.</p>

<p>Of course, sometimes we will want entirely new spacecraft, as these things are not designed to last forever. However, because this reusability feature reduces the cost of future missions, the likelihood that they&rsquo;ll fly will be increased. Having a perfectly good spacecraft ready and waiting on Earth orbit makes it much easier for decision-makers to approve additional missions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>On-orbit construction</h2>

<p><em>Adeona</em> is assembled in LEO from sections that will need to be launched separately, due to their size:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The BA 330 module. This may be launched deflated and inflated once on orbit, or it may be launched already inflated and fitted out.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cruise stage, comprised of engines, fuel tanks, fuel, navigation and communications.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Mars Direct does not require on-orbit assembly, which it presents as a drawback because of the additional cost and risk involved. However, the trade-offs are having to land in the habitat (the outbound transit and surface habitat are one), which is more dangerous than in a capsule, and having to use a different vehicle (the ERV) for the return trip to Earth, which is much smaller and will have a completely different design to the outbound habitat. The ERV is not reusable and must perform direct entry on return to Earth, which is also far more dangerous than descending to Earth from orbit in a capsule, a process that will be well-tested by the time it&rsquo;s used for Mars crews.</p>

<p>Although it adds some additional cost and complexity to the architecture, on-orbit assembly is no longer a significant space engineering challenge. The ISS was assembled in LEO and was much more complex than <em>Adeona</em>. Admittedly, we will not have access to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle" target="_blank">Space Shuttle</a>, which was a key element in ISS construction; however, we can certainly make do without the Shuttle. The Apollo LEM and command modules were docked on orbit without the benefit of the Space Shuttle.</p>

<p>On-orbit assembly makes Blue Dragon slightly more complex than Mars Direct or even DRA, but it&rsquo;s still much simpler than von Braun&rsquo;s MarsProjekt, or the process developed for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Exploration_Initiative" target="_blank">Space Exploration Initiative</a>, and simpler than the ISS. Most importantly, it allows us to build a better vehicle.</p>

<p>At this time SpaceX Falcon rockets are the preferred candidate for launching the various sections of <em>Adeona</em>, as for other elements of the Blue Dragon architecture, primarily due to their low cost, high technology, and potential for reusability. Alternately, an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V" target="_blank">Atlas V</a> could be used to deliver the BA 330 to orbit, which is the vehicle currently under consideration for this purpose by Bigelow Aerospace.</p>

<p>The BA 330 may be launched deflated, reducing the cost of launch, as a vehicle with a smaller payload fairing diameter can be used. The payload fairing of an Falcon Heavy is 5.2m, and for an Atlas V it is 5.4m. The diameter of an inflated BA 330 is 6.7m, but the deflated diameter is estimated to be only about half that, aroud 3.5m. This means an Atlas V Heavy with a 4m could potentially be used.</p>

<p>A BA 330 module weighs 20-23 tonnes, whereas an Atlas V Heavy can deliver 29 tonnes to LEO. Therefore, if an Atlas V is to be used, up to 6-9 tonnes of food, water and other supplies could be packed into the BA 330 prior to launch. If a Falcon Heavy is used, which can deliver up to 53 tonnes to LEO, then the Transit Hab can be packed with up to 30 tonnes of gear and supplies.</p>

<p>However, if the BA 330 is launched deflated it will be empty after being inflated on orbit. This may necessitate at least one additional launch to deliver a fit-out crew to load supplies and fit-out the inside of the ship, including floors, cupboards, desks, beds, gym, laboratory, computers and solar storm shelter (the bathroom is already part of the BA 330 core). It is almost certainly preferable, simpler and safer to inflate, fit-out and stock the BA 330 on Earth prior to launch. Although this will require a larger vehicle to launch the module, it will avoid the cost of launching a fit-out crew as well as the necessary tools, supplies and equipment, and the risk to those astronauts.</p>

<p>The challenge, however, is finding a suitably capable vehicle that can accommodate a 6.7m-diameter payload. The obvious candidate is the SLS currently under development by NASA, which has a payload fairing of 8.4m. The Block IA Cargo version is capable of lifting 105 tonnes to LEO, which is obviously massive overkill in terms of launch capability, but it may be possible to include part of the cruise stage in the payload.</p>

<p>Additional Falcon 9 launches will be necessary for one or more on-orbit training exercises, and to deliver Alpha Crew to <em>Adeona</em> prior to TMI. <em>Adeona</em> will have a docking port at one end for the DragonRider capsules that will ferry crew members between <em>Adeona</em> and the surfaces of Mars and Earth. The other end of the BA 330 module will be attached to the cruise stage.</p>
