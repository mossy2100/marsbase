<p>The DRA details food requirements for a crew of six on a long-stay human mission to Mars. If Blue Dragon uses the same food system as the DRA (which is likely to be similar to or based on the same food system developed for the ISS), then the food requirements will be effectively the same because the crew size and duration of both the space and surface element are the same.</p>

<p>However, with new innovations in food technology it may be possible to substantially decrease the mass, volume, energy and time requirements of the food system.</p>

<h2>Powdered food</h2>

<p>New powdered food products such as <a href="https://campaign.soylent.me/soylent-free-your-body" target="_blank">Soylent</a> [RHINEHART] are currently emerging, which claim to be nutritionally complete and carry a wide range of advantages. They require minimal time to prepare (just mix with water), require minimal cleanup, produce no waste, have an extended shelf life, and do not require refrigeration or heating. There is also evidence, albeit largely anecdotal at this stage, that subsisting primarily on such foods is beneficial for health and improves mental clarity. By ensuring that all the body&rsquo;s nutritional needs are met in an optimised way this type of food is arguably far healthier than a typical human diet.</p>

<p>Powdered food is extremely well-suited to space missions, being especially lightweight and compact, catering for the crew&rsquo;s complete nutritional requirements in the most efficient way possible, and arguably optimising physical and mental function of the crew. It would eliminate the need for refrigeration and cooking equipment, thereby greatly reducing associated mass, volume, time and energy requirements.</p>

<p>Evidence of a substantial market for no-fuss, efficient food of this type has become apparent, suggesting that investment in this food technology will increase. The likely result will be numerous innovations including improved formulas and flavours, which we can expect to emerge during the next 1-2 decades; which is to say, before the first H2M missions. A formula could be developed, perhaps higher in specific nutrients such as calcium and protein or even including performance-enhancing or medicinal drugs (such as osteoporosis drugs) optimised for astronauts spending time in low gravity environments.</p>

<p>It has been claimed the experience of spending time with other crew members in familiar domestic situations such as preparing meals and eating together is useful for building relationships and morale. Meal times provide an opportunity for swapping stories and jokes, and there&rsquo;s a concern that providing the crew with nothing but simple powdered food for 2.5 years would deprive them of that fun, relaxing, social experience and could therefore potentially exacerbate feelings of boredom or frustration, or even contribute to mental health issues.</p>

<p>However, this is a space mission, not an ocean cruise or analog simulation. Every kilogram saved in terms of food, packaging, storage and food-preparation equipment means a lighter and cheaper mission, which therefore reduces cost and increases viability. If we ask a group of astronaut candidates: &ldquo;Would you go to Mars if it meant living on nothing but powdered food for 2.5 years?&rdquo; there&rsquo;s little doubt they would all happily accept that condition.</p>

<p>Indeed, the astronauts may have so much to do, especially once on Mars, that they may appreciate not having to invest significant time each day to food preparation and consumption. To mix and consume a shake 2-3 times per day could reduce food preparation and consumption time to under 30 minutes per day, per crew member.</p>

<p>As powdered food technology develops, there&rsquo;s no doubt that a wide variety of flavours (chocolate, apple, bacon, etc.) will become available. A range of powdered flavour additives could be included for mixing with a plain blend, allowing the crew to be creative, make their own favourite combinations, and to vary their diet as desired without compromising their nutrition.</p>

<p>It may be that a combination of powdered and &ldquo;normal&rdquo; space food is recommended, with powdered food being consumed most of the time, but with a social crew meal perhaps 1-2 times per week or month. However, this is probably a luxury and not an essential requirement, and it would require analysis as to whether the additional mass and cost associated with the food storage and preparation necessary for those occasional meals would be worth the psychological benefit, or whether an equivalent psychological benefit could be produced some other way, such as regular meetings over, say, tea, or group social activities such as movies or Travel Scrabble.</p>

<p>The high nutritional density of powdered food produces highly efficient utility by the body, and thus reduced mass and volume of solid waste. This correspondingly reduces energy required to process waste, or volume required to store it. In addition, as the whole crew is eating the same food for the entire mission, the chemical profile of waste products is highly predictable, which may suggest opportunities for more efficient or useful methods of processing or recycling waste.</p>

<p>Soylent, the best known powered food currently available, is vegan. One benefit of vegan food, apart from the obvious benefit that no cruelty to animals is involved in its production, is that the fecal waste can be used directly as fertiliser. This will be very useful in food production (see ISFP, below). Fecal waste from omnivores/carnivores can only be used as fertiliser if composted with plant matter such as grass clippings, which may be in short supply on Mars.</p>

<p>Summary of advantages of powdered food:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<p>Drastically reduce or eliminate mass of packaging, refrigeration, storage and preparation equipment, utensils and dishes.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Eliminate energy requirements for refrigeration and cooking.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Greatly reduce water requirements for washing dishes (everyone just has one shaker each).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Improved health and mental clarity.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Reduce quantity of solid waste produced.</p>
	</li>

<h2>ISFP (In Situ Food Production)</h2>

<p>Explorers and settlers of Mars will naturally want to grow their own food. Even from the very first mission, it&rsquo;s likely that astronauts will want to experiment with growing food. However, Blue Dragon does not propose that the crew should rely on locally produced food during at least the first few missions, as it will take some time to develop and establish Martian agricultural practices, including methods for obtaining local water, as well as deliver the necessary infrastructure to Mars. Therefore, all the food required for the space and surface elements of the mission will be transported from Earth.</p>

<p>As yet, we have no evidence that it will be possible to grow any kind of plant on Mars, although research is being conducted in this area that shows promising results [WAMELINK]. However, considering the following constraints, it would be safer not to rely on ISFP for at least the first few human missions:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		<p>With our current level of technology, production of nutritionally-complete food for the crew would require growing a range of different plants. It remains to be seen if a nutritionally-complete set of crops could be reliably produced in a restricted volume.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Growing plants requires equipment, such as pipes, hoses, trays, racks, lights, filters, tools, containers and much more. This adds launch mass, probably more than that of prepackaged food.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Growing plants requires volume. Whether growing the plants in Martian dirt, or using a hydroponic or areoponic system, a significant volume would be required to produce food for a crew of six; certainly far more than will be required be prepackaged food. Providing this volume would necessitate a larger Surface Hab or a greenhouse module, which would significantly impact the launch mass and the cost and complexity of the architecture.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Growing plants requires water. Whether the crew&rsquo;s water is transported from Earth or obtained locally, it will be a precious and valuable resource. ISFP may significantly increase launch mass in terms of either water, or the equipment necessary to obtain it. Although the amount of water required to grow plants could be greatly reduced with an aeroponic system, it remains to be seen if a nutritionally-complete set of crops can be entirely grown aeroponically.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Growing plants requires light. Solar intensity on Mars is only about half that of Earth, which is sufficient for photosynthesis, but may result in slow growth in some plant specie, which could be a risk. Artificial light may be a solution, but that would increase energy requirements.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Growing plants requires environment control. If the greenhouse is connected to the Surface Hab, then the Hab&rsquo;s ECLSS will need to maintain the temperature and atmospheric conditions of a much larger volume, which will therefore require more energy and a larger ECLSS unit. If the greenhouse is separate from the Hab, it will require its own ECLSS, which will require additional energy and increase launch mass.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Growing plants produces waste. Perhaps the waste vegetable matter could be processed into mulch, but this is only relevant if the plants are grown in soil; yet hydroponic or aeroponic systems may be preferred in the early stages of human exploration of Mars. Dumping waste vegetable matter on the surface of Mars may violate planetary protection protocols. The plant waste may need to be incinerated (as with excrement), requiring energy.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>With all this in mind, it&rsquo;s better for the crew to bring their own food for the first few missions. Nonetheless, ISFP is a key capability that needs to be developed for human settlement of Mars, and the missions should incorporate experimentation into food production and growing a few simple crops while at Mars. This is mentioned in section 3.2.1.1 of the DRA:</p>

<blockquote><em>There are three resulting objectives in the Mars Human Habitability/ISRU area. The first objective is to develop the capability of providing crew needs from local resources. An example of this is in-situ food production.</em></blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Mars One</h4>

<p>The Mars One mission plan calls for astronauts to grow their own food on Mars. If successful, their efforts will be instructive in future ISFP practices.</p>

<ol>
	<li>High-efficiency food production systems such as <a href="http://www.plantlab.nl/" target="_blank">PlantLab</a> will be utilised.</li>
	<li>Following research conducted by NASA, plants will be grown under LED lighting that only produces frequencies that can be utilised by plants, thereby reducing energy requirements.</li>
	<li>Plants will be grown hydroponically, eliminating the need for soil.</li>
	<li>Plants will be grown in racks, one above the next, reducing space requirements.</li>
</ol>

<p>It is believed that 50m<sup>2</sup> will be available for plant growth, and that this will produce enough food for 12 astronauts.</p>
