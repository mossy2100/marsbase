<p>Green Dragon is a precursor mission to Blue Dragon that will land one or more Dragon capsules on Mars containing integrated ISRU hardware capable of manufacturing several important products from local Martian resources. The mission is designed to advance our capabilities and build confidence in two main areas: EDL and ISRU.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>EDL (Entry, Descent and Landing)</h2>

<p>One of the main reasons for Green Dragon is to gain practice landing Red Dragon capsules on Mars, refine the technology, and build confidence that this can be done repeatably and safely. If Mars One is successfully implemented in advance of Blue Dragon, then this approach of EDL via capsule may already have been proven. Either way, the more experience we have, the better. By the time we land a crew on the surface of Mars in a DragonRider capsule, we will ideally have already landed several Red Dragon capsules on Mars:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<p>1+ for Green Dragon</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>2+ cargo capsules for Blue Dragon</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Any launched by Mars One</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>The more Red Dragon capsules we land on Mars before sending humans, the more confidence we will have in the technology before using a DragonRider to land a crew on the surface of Mars. We need to know exactly how the capsule behaves during EDL to Mars, how it interacts with the Martian atmosphere and surface (especially dust), how to land one of these things on a dime, and where the strengths and weaknesses are in this approach. This knowledge can only be obtained with practice.</p>

<p>It is also necessary to test and, if possible or necessary, improve the accuracy of landing. SpaceX claim that Dragon capsules will be capable of pinpoint landings on Mars; other navigation algorithms that could be tested in this mission include LION and G-FOLD.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>ISRU (In Situ Resource Utilisation)</h2>

<p>The intention is to test ISRU systems for producing breathable air (O2 and buffer gas), potable water, and potentially also LOX/LCH4 propellant. A secondary but non-trivial goal is to create backup caches of critical resources near the IMRS that may be accessed in case of emergency.</p>

<p>One goal of Blue Dragon is to not take any hydrogen, water, air or ascent propellant to the surface of Mars, but to obtain all of these from local resources. Developing the necessary technology to achieve this will greatly reduce the mass of consumables that need to be transported to Mars, both now and in the future, thus reducing the cost of Mars exploration. This is the main reason why engineering precursor missions are necessary, to develop the technologies to make what we need on Mars.</p>

<p>Proposals for ISRU tech for Mars have traditionally been fairly conservative, mainly because these resources are in the critical path for the mission, and no-one wants to risk LOC. However, with the success of recent, complex missions such as Spirit, Opportunity, Phoenix and Curiosity, we can afford to be more confident. The purpose of the Green Dragon program is to increase the TRL of ISRU technology in preparation for sending humans to Mars.</p>

<p>Green Dragon contains a set of four integrated ISRU experiments:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p><strong>ISEP</strong> (In Situ Electricity Production) - Electricital power is produced from solar energy using one or more rolls of PV material.</p>

	<p><strong>ISAP</strong> (In Situ Air Production) - Oxygen is obtained by electrolysis of water; buffer gas is produced by cleaning the gas mix that remains after dust, water and carbon dioxide is removed from Martian air.</p>

	<p><strong>ISWP</strong> (In Situ Water Production) - Water is extracted from the air, and surrounding regolith using microwave radiation, heat, and a small rover (AWESOM) powered by an SRG.</p>

	<p><strong>ISPP</strong> (In Situ Propellant Production) - Water is electrolysed into hydrogen and oxygen; hydrogen is reacted with carbon dioxide (CO2) to produce methane (CH4).</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>MARCO POLO</h2>

<p>The integrated ISRU approach proposed for Green Dragon is partly inspired by the recent work done on the MARCO POLO mission [INTERBARTOLO]. MARCO POLO comprises an octagonal lander that processes Martian soil and atmosphere to produce air, water and LOX/LCH4 propellant, which is basically the same concept as Green Dragon.</p>

<p>The main differences are as follows:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		<p>Green Dragon is built into a SpaceX Red Dragon capsule, which will greatly reduce the cost of the lander and EDL system.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>In MARCO POLO, a robot collects soil and transports it to the lander for water extraction. In Green Dragon, soil processing and water extraction is performed by the robot itself, which then brings the water back to the lander for filtering and partial electrolysis. This is more efficient and will enable a larger quantity of water to be collected.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>MARCO POLO includes testing of closed-loop power production by burning LOX/LCH4 in a fuel cell. This feature is not considered essential because the use of fuel cells is not currently part of the plan for the Blue Dragon human mission. Instead, power production using rolls of PV material is tested, as this <em>is</em> important for the human mission. The challenge is to produce sufficient power from solar energy, which is a requirement for the MAV and Surface Hab.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>MARCO POLO includes testing of combustion of LOX/LCH4 in order to produce thrust. This feature is also not currently considered for Green Dragon, as ISPP and thrust is tested more thoroughly in the Gold Dragon mission.</p>
	</li>
</ol>
