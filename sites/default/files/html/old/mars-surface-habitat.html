<p>The Mars Surface Habitat, a.k.a. &ldquo;the Surface Hab&rdquo;, is arguably the most important item of hardware in the entire architecture, as its purpose is to healthfully accommodate crews of up to six astronauts on the surface of Mars for about 1.5 years at a stretch. It must incorporate sleeping quarters, food preparation facilities, workstations, laboratories and other work areas, bathroom, medical facilities, subsystems for ECLSS, power, communications and computing, and storage for food, water, air, personal effects and other items.</p>

<p>As the Transit Hab is based on a BA 330-DS, so the Surface Hab is based on a BA 330-MDS, which is a version of the BA 330 adapted for use on the surface of the Moon or Mars. The BA 330 modules provide radiation protection comparable to the ISS, which will protect the crew during their stay and obviate the need to cover the habitat in dirt to provide additional protection; a process that is often recommended for Mars habitats, but that would be challenging. A BA 330-MDS module is perfectly well-suited for this purpose, yet will presumably be much cheaper than a custom-built unit, being a COTS item, although some customisation is inevitable.</p>

<p>An important advantage is gained by using the same habitat technology in the MTV as on the surface of Mars, i.e. commonality of hardware. It means fewer systems for the crew to learn and understand. If they are capable of repairing something in the Transit Hab, they&rsquo;ll be similarly capable of repairing the Surface Hab should the need arise.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>ECLSS</h2>

<p>The BA 330 modules and their DS and MDS variants include life support for up to six astronauts. This ECLSS system is built into the solid core of the module, along with the bathroom. Additional details regarding the layout of the BA 330-MDS modules are currently unavailable, but we can speculate that this core may or may not include facilities for a solar storm shelter, storage for food, water and air, and perhaps also cooking and refrigeration equipment. Note, however, if the recommendation to use powdered food is followed, cooking and refrigeration equipment will not be required, and, if present, may be removed. Please refer to the section on <a href="/food">Food</a> for further discussion on the advantages of using powdered food in early Mars missions.</p>

<h3>Air</h3>

<p>One of the goals for the Surface Hab in the Blue Dragon architecture is that it include an ISAP (In Situ Air Production) system that will manufacture breathable air for the crew and replace losses due to leakage, recycling, airlock cycling and other factors. The inclusion of such a system as part of the Hab&rsquo;s ECLSS obviates the need to bring quantities of O2 and N2 from Earth. The design of the ISAP system is described in greater detail in the section about <a href="/air">Air</a>.</p>

<p>The Surface Hab will include both internal and external tanks of O2 and a buffer gas mixture comprised of N2 and Ar in approximately equal parts (the ratio between these two gases will be equal to the ratio in which they are present in the Martian atmosphere, from where they will be obtained). Internal tanks will enable regulation of the habitat&rsquo;s interior pressure and atmospheric composition as part of the ECLSS, as on the ISS, and potentially could also be used for refilling marssuit O2 tanks. External tanks will primarily be useful for refilling the O2 and buffer gas tanks on the MEV (the Mars Exploration Vehicle, a.k.a. &ldquo;the Rover&rdquo;), although could potentially also be used for refilling marssuit O2 tanks.</p>

<h3>Water</h3>

<p>A related design goal is for the Hab to include an ISWP (In Situ Water Production) system and produce its own potable water from local resources. This is significantly more challenging than manufacturing air, however, since the Martian atmosphere contains very little water vapour, thus necessitating that the H2O be obtained from regolith surrounding the Hab. This requires a mobile robotic system, which, for the purpose of this exercise, has been named AWESOM (Autonomous Water Extraction from the Surface Of Mars). The AWESOM ISWP system has been described for potential use with the <a href="/mars-ascent-vehicle">MAV</a>, and in greater detail in the section on <a href="/water">Water</a>.</p>

<p>Whether or not including an ISWP system like this with the Surface Hab will be practical is yet to be determined. It may well be that the first couple of missions instead carry with them a supply of H2 (as described in the DRA) with which to manufacture water by combining it with O2 produced by the ISAP system. However, this would introduce the various problems associated with transporting and storing H2 that have been discussed elsewhere in this document, in addition to the risk of explosion introduced by storing H2 in an O2-filled hab.</p>

<p>Even if it cannot be included from the first mission, ISWP is a capability that must be developed for permanent occupation of Mars, hence development of the necessary technology to achieve this should ideally commence as early as possible. Future missions can include a suitable ISWP system once it has been developed, tested on Mars and shown to be reliable.</p>

<p>Note that a small quantity of water can be collected from the Martian atmosphere as part of the ISAP process if it incorporates a device like a WAVAR [GROVER], which adsorbs water from the atmosphere using zeolite 3A. This can offset water consumption by the crew, in addition to a high-efficiency recycling system.</p>

<h2>Landing</h2>

<p>A BA 330 module weighs approximately 20-23 tonnes, which necessitates a SHLLV in order to deliver one to the surface of Mars. It would be difficult to reduce this mass by developing a custom-built habitat without reducing the crew size, simply because of the amount of equipment required to keep a crew of six alive and happy for this length of time. Most estimates for Mars habitats exceed 20 tonnes.</p>

<p>Therefore, the Blue Dragon architecture, like most Mars mission architectures, is reliant on the availability of a suitable SHLLV. It&rsquo;s likely, if all goes well, that we will have a choice of potentially three such vehicles by the time we begin sending humans to Mars:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Launch_System" target="_blank">Space Launch System</a>, currently being developed by NASA</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_(rocket_family)#Future_concepts" target="_blank">Falcon X</a>, potentially to be developed by SpaceX</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_March_(rocket_family)#Long_March_9" target="_blank">Long March 9</a>, being studied by CNSA.</li>
</ol>

<p>Any of these rockets should be capable of delivering payloads of up to about 30 tonnes to the surface of Mars. This constraint dictates a mass budget of about 7-10 tonnes of additional supplies that may be packed within the habitat. In the event that the total quantity of supplies and equipment required by a crew exceeds this amount, additional tonnage can be delivered to Mars surface with Red Dragon capsules. After the first couple of missions, once the habitats are being reused by subsequent crews, ongoing resupply will be via these capsules.</p>

<p>As discussed in the section about <a href="/land-capsules-not-habs">landing crews on Mars in capsules instead of habitats</a>, unlike Mars Direct and the DRA, the Hab is landed <em>uncrewed</em> for reasons of improved safety and reduced program cost. Crew safety is improved because capsules are likely to represent a far more reliable landing system than that developed for Surface Habs. For one thing, this is because capsules are lighter. Habitats, along with MAV&rsquo;s will be the heaviest things ever landed on Mars, and the heavier something is to land on Mars the more difficult, complex and risky it is. In addition, capsules will probably be used much more frequently for delivering both crews and cargo to Mars. Capsule-based robotic precursor missions and predeployment of cargo to Mars will permit several opportunities to test capsule landings without involving a crew, thereby enabling engineers to refine and improve capsule landing systems, improving their TRL and safeness prior to their use for landing crews.</p>

<p>The program cost is also reduced by landing crews in capsules, since these are likely to be significantly cheaper than habitats. Obviously, an architecture that requires landing crews in habitats means that a new habitat is required for every mission. By landing crews in capsules, only two habitats (a minimum) need to be delivered to Mars, which can be used over and over by multiple missions.</p>

<p>The Hab will be sent to Mars within the same launch opportunity as the MAV, and travel on a slow 9-month trajectory like the MAV and other cargo. The Hab and MAV will not be landed right next to each other, but approximately several hundred metres up to 1km distant, in order that the launch of the MAV does not adversely affect the Hab&#39;s systems; for example, by burning or melting anything with rocket exhaust, or by covering the Hab&#39;s solar panels in dust. Upon landing successfully on Mars surface, the Hab will be remotely activated and several processes initiated:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Rolls of PV material will be extracted and unrolled with the help of the Rover or other mobile robot, and the power system activated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ISAP unit will be activated and production of O2 and N2/Ar buffer gas will commence. If the Hab is not delivered in a fully inflated state, then it will be inflated using this air.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Water tanks will be filled, either by virtue of the ISWP system, or by combining brought H2 with locally produced O2.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Orientation</h2>

<p>For the basic form of the Hab, previous architectures such as Mars Direct have primarily focused on a vertical cylinder, or the so-called &ldquo;tuna can&rdquo; model:</p>

<figure><a class="colorbox" href="/sites/default/files/images/tuna-can-habs.jpg" title="/sites/default/files/images/tuna-can-habs_0.jpg"><img alt="“Tuna can” habitats on Mars" src="/sites/default/files/images/tuna-can-habs_0.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 163px;" title="Click to embiggen" /></a>

  <figcaption>&rdquo;Tuna can&quot; habitats on Mars</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>These habitats have a diameter of around eight metres, which fits neatly inside the 8.4m diameter payload fairing of a Space Launch System rocket. The proposed SpaceX SHLLV Falcon X is also expected to have a fairing diameter of around 8m.</p>

<p>Although a BA 330 may seem ideal for vertical orientation like the tuna-can design, in fact, because the airlock is at the end, it is more useful if oriented horizontally. This model of a Mars base constructed from BA 330 modules illustrates a horizontal configuration for the modules:</p>

<h2>Redundancy and safety</h2>

<p>The Blue Dragon architecture provides every crew with a backup hab from the very first mission. The first Hab (MSH-1) is sent in the predeployment phase for the Alpha Mission, scheduled for 2031, and will therefore have been activated, tested and filled with air and water in preparation for the arrival of Alpha Crew approximately two years after. Note, however, that the launch opportunity for the Alpha Crew outbound trip in 2033 is the same as for the predeployment phase of Bravo Mission. Hence, the second Hab (MSH-2) will be en route to Mars at the same time as the first crew (along with the second MAV and other equipment required for Bravo Mission).</p>

<p>Most of the equipment being predeployed for Bravo Mission will be travelling on a slow 9-month trajectory, in order to save fuel, while Alpha Crew will be travelling on a much quicker 4-6 month trajectory, in order to protect their health. However, MSH-2 should also be sent on a fast trajectory if possible, in order to reduce (ideally to zero) the amount of time Alpha Crew is without a backup Hab. When MSH-2 arrives at the IMRS, they can monitor its setup. Once its systems are fully operational, Alpha Crew will have an alternate home in MSH-2 should there be any malfunction with MSH-1 during their surface mission. Assuming that the two Habs are well-maintained during their lifetime, the next ten or however many missions will have a spare Hab available if necessary.</p>

<p>Note that although Alpha Crew may be without a backup Hab for a brief period, the <a href="/mars-exploration-vehicle">Rover</a> may be used as an emergency lifeboat if necessary. (Note, also, that none of the crewed Apollo missions had a backup Hab, and never needed one.)</p>

<p>In theory, only two Surface Habs are strictly required for the IMRS: one for the crew, and one spare. This is fortunate, because, by not needing to include a Hab in those missions from Charlie Mission onwards, the money saved can be funnelled into other equipment such as greenhouses, power systems, heavy machinery, etc. Having said that, it is expected that the base will expand as the cost of space transportation and habitat modules decreases, space technology improves, participating space agencies seek to expand their activities on Mars, and some astronauts opt to remain for multiple seasons at a stretch or even permanently on Mars.</p>
