<h2>Spelling alphabet</h2>

<p>The first mission to the IMRS is called &ldquo;Alpha Mission&rdquo; and the first crew is called &ldquo;Alpha Crew&rdquo;, the second mission is called &ldquo;Bravo Mission&rdquo; and the second crew is named &ldquo;Bravo Crew&rdquo;, and so on, following the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_radiotelephony_spelling_alphabet" target="_blank">International Radiotelephony Spelling Alphabet</a>. This pattern has been adopted to support clear radio communications between different Mars exploration crews and Earth, which will become increasingly important when multiple crew are off Earth at the same time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Friendly names</h2>

<p>To mitigate acronym overload, the primary elements of the mission have been given &ldquo;friendly&rdquo; names.</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		<p>The MTV (Mars Transfer Vehicle) is named &ldquo;<em>Adeona</em>&rdquo;, which is the name of the Roman goddess of safe return. It comes from the Latin verb adeo, &ldquo;to approach or visit&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;to take possession of one&rsquo;s inheritance&rdquo;. Mars is our inheritance and we hope for a safe return for the crew.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>The MAV (Mars Ascent Vehicle) is named &ldquo;<em>Athena</em>&rdquo;, which is the name of the Greek goddess of wisdom, courage, inspiration, civilisation, law and justice, mathematics, strength, strategy, the arts, crafts, and skill. <em>Athena</em> is the companion of heroes and patron goddess of heroic endeavour.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>The DragonRider capsules that carry the crew between the surfaces and orbits of Earth and Mars are named &ldquo;Pern-1&rdquo;, &ldquo;Pern-2&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pern-3&rdquo;. These names comes from the novel &ldquo;Dragonriders of Pern&rdquo; by Anne McCaffrey.</p>

		<ol>
			<li>
				<p><em>Pern-1</em> carries the crew from Earth surface to Earth orbit, and Mars orbit to Mars surface. It becomes part of the base where it may be repurposed as a laboratory, shelter or storage container.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><em>Pern-2</em> forms the uppermost stage of <em>Athena</em> and is discarded at the end of the surface mission, after being used to transport the crew to the MTV. It&rsquo;s a modified capsule without heat shield, SuperDraco thrusters or fuel tanks (although it will retain RCS).</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><em>Pern-3</em> is used to pick up the crew on their return to Earth, and is therefore reusable.</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>The Mars Transit Habitat is known more simply as &ldquo;the Transit Hab&rdquo;.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>The Mars Surface Habitat is known more simply as &ldquo;the Surface Hab&rdquo;.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>The Mars Exploration Vehicle is known simply as &ldquo;the Rover&rdquo;.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>The names <em>Adeona</em>, <em>Athena</em>, <em>Pern-1</em>, <em>Pern-2</em> and <em>Pern-3</em> are italicised, following the convention for ship names.</p>
