<p>SpaceX have developed a space capsule known as <em>Dragon</em>. The Dragon capsule has been developed as part of NASA&rsquo;s Commercial Resupply Services program, primarily for transporting cargo to and from the ISS. SpaceX made history in 2012 when the Dragon became the first commercial spacecraft ever to dock with the ISS.</p>

<p>Dragon capsules are launched by SpaceX&rsquo;s Falcon 9 rockets. The current version of the Dragon is designed to splash down in water, like those used in NASA&rsquo;s Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs and like NASA&rsquo;s new Orion capsule. However, the latest version of the Dragon capsule, known as <em>Dragon V2</em>, is capable of landing on solid ground.</p>

<p>The Dragon V2 features eight <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperDraco_(rocket_engine)" target="_blank">SuperDraco</a>&nbsp;engines, which are a powerful new variation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draco_(rocket_engine)" target="_blank">Draco</a> engines used by the Dragon&rsquo;s RCS (Reaction Control System). Like the Draco, it uses non-cryogenic propellant, namely monomethyl hydrazine fuel and nitrogen tetroxide oxidiser, however, it&rsquo;s about 200 times as powerful, capable of delivering about 67 kilonewtons of axial thrust for a total of about 534kN. The SuperDraco engine is the first ever fully 3D printed rocket engine.</p>

<p>With the SuperDraco engines, the Dragon V2 is able to land propulsively on solid ground, thus saving the time and expense of water recovery. On Earth this will usually be back at the original launchpad, but they can also land on the Moon, Mars or potentially other worlds with solid surfaces. This is in alignment with SpaceX CEO Elon Musk&rsquo;s stated purpose of establishing settlements on Mars.</p>

<h2>DragonRider</h2>

<p>SpaceX offer two basic configurations for the Dragon capsules: cargo and crew. The crewed version is known as a &ldquo;DragonRider&rdquo;, and can accommodate up to seven astronauts. These may be used for transporting crew between Earth and the ISS in the near future.</p>

<p>In the Blue Dragon architecture, which is designed for a crew of six, the seventh seat may be removed and the volume that it (and a seventh person) would have occupied can be used for cargo. This may be last minute personal items from Earth, or samples from Mars. All three DragonRiders in the architecture will be modified in this way to accommodate six people plus storage.</p>

<h2>Red Dragon</h2>

<p>NASA has begun researching a Mars lander called&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dragon_(spacecraft)" target="_blank">Red Dragon</a>, a proposed variant of the SpaceX Dragon capsule that will provide a comparatively low cost technology for delivering payloads to the surface of Mars [KARCZ].</p>

<figure><a class="colorbox" href="/sites/default/files/images/mars-dragon-landing.jpg" title="Red Dragon landing on Mars"><img alt="Red Dragon landing on Mars" src="/sites/default/files/images/mars-dragon-landing_0.jpg" style="height:177px; width:300px" title="Click to embiggen" /></a>

	<figcaption>Red Dragon landing on Mars</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Red Dragon will also be configured with SuperDraco engines. It has been calculated that they will be powerful enough for landing propulsively on Mars. In addition, Red Dragon will incorporate several modifications necessary for EDL on Mars, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<p>Removal of systems unique to LEO missions, such as berthing hardware.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Addition of deep space communications.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Modifications to SuperDraco (or Raptor) engines to suit the Martian atmosphere.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Reduction of heat shield thickness, since the atmosphere is far less dense.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Algorithms and avionics for pinpoint landing on Mars.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>The gravity on Mars is lower on Earth, which means the acceleration of the capsule towards Mars is comparatively lower. However, in the case of direct entry, the capsule will be approaching from interplanetary space at a much higher velocity than if it were descending to the surface of Earth from Earth orbit. Mars&rsquo; atmosphere is much thinner (less than 1%) than Earth&rsquo;s, so it will play less of a role in reducing spacecraft velocity during EDL; for the same reason, the effect of atmospheric friction will be less. These different conditions will affect the forces experienced by the spacecraft during EDL, which may necessitate changes to thrusters, heat shield, avionics and other parts of the spacecraft.</p>

<p>NASA have calculated that a Red Dragon capsule will be capable of delivering payloads of up to 1.9 metric tonnes to the surface of Mars. This delivery mechanism has been receiving increasing attention from NASA, being considerably simpler and cheaper than existing landing techniques, such as the sky crane method used to deliver <em>Curiosity</em>. Not only will it be cheaper per kilogram of payload mass, but cheaper overall.</p>

<p>Another advantage is that a landed capsule can be repurposed as a storage unit, shelter or habitat.</p>

<p>Once the Red Dragon technology has been proven as a reliable mechanism for delivery of cargo, this approach may be used to deliver up to seven crew members to Mars surface by using a DragonRider modified in the same way.</p>

<p>Red Dragon represents a near term technology that can enable comparatively inexpensive and functional Mars missions. It&rsquo;s a fundamental element of the Blue Dragon architecture (hence the name), being utilised for delivery of both crew and cargo to Mars surface.</p>

<p>The Dragon capsules are being designed to land with a high degree of accuracy. From the SpaceX website:</p>

<p>&quot;<em>SuperDraco engines will power a revolutionary launch escape system that will make Dragon the safest spacecraft in history and enable it to land propulsively on Earth or another planet with pinpoint accuracy.&quot;</em></p>

<p>This ability to land &ldquo;with pinpoint accuracy&rdquo; is supported by the Dragon&rsquo;s GNC (Guidance, Navigation and Control) system. Due to the lack of GPS (Global Positioning System) on Mars, high-accuracy landings must be achieved using alternate methods. However, this problem has effectively been solved. For example, ESA (European Space Agency) have been developing a system known as &ldquo;LION&rdquo; (Landing with Inertial and Optical Navigation) that will enable pinpoint landing on the Moon, Mars and asteroids using image recognition of major landmarks [DELAUNE]. Another important development is the Fuel Optimal Large Divert Guidance (G-FOLD) algorithm [ACIKMESE], able to autonomously calculate landing trajectories in real-time. This was recently tested successfully with Masten Space System&rsquo;s Xombie VTOL experimental rocket, with the vehicle making a 750 metre course correction in real time. Using these or similar technologies the Red Dragon will be capable of pinpoint landings on Mars. Because the position of landed base components can be known with precision, a neat, safe and optimised layout of the base can be determined beforehand.</p>

<p>Red Dragon potentially represents a mechanism for delivering cargo or crew to the surface of Mars that is not only repeatable, but affordable. SpaceX currently charge $135M for a Falcon Heavy launch including the Dragon capsule. Making use of COTS and other pre-developed hardware it may be possible to develop and deliver a payload to Mars for under $250M. This is a mere one tenth of the $2.5B <em>Curiosity</em> rover.</p>

<p>Once SpaceX have developed their RLS (Reusable Launch System) for the Falcon Heavy - a goal likely to be achieved within a few years, considering the recent Grasshopper tests, and thus well before the first H2M mission - this price will come down even further.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Big Red Dragon</h3>

<p>Dragon capsules have a diameter of 3.7 metres. However, the architecture for the Mars One mission, which proposes to send 24-40 astronauts on a one-way mission to Mars, proposes to rely on a larger, 5-metre-diameter Dragon capsule for habitat modules. Although these are yet be to be built or demonstrated, their plan is to land the first two of these on Mars in 2020, which is only seven years from the time of writing.</p>

<p>It could perhaps be inferred that plans exist at SpaceX to have these larger Dragon capsules operational and available within seven years, which is well within the timeline of Blue Dragon. However, SpaceX and Mars One do not have a formal association, so there is no real evidence of this yet. As no information about these larger capsules is currently available, the Blue Dragon architecture does not presently include them. This may change if more information becomes available.</p>

<h2>Ice Dragon</h2>

<p>NASA have commenced studies of a mission to Mars based on the Red Dragon landing system, which may be flown as early as 2018. Known as &ldquo;Ice Dragon&rdquo; [STOKER], it&rsquo;s being developed in collaboration with SpaceX, and will deliver a science package to Mars including a drill that will penetrate up to two metres into the permafrost to investigate environmental conditions suitable for past or extant life.</p>

<p>There are six objectives currently envisaged for Ice Dragon:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		<p>Determine if life ever arose on Mars.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Assess subsurface habitability.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Establish the origin, vertical distribution and composition of ground ice.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Assess potential human hazards in dust, regolith and ground ice, and cosmic radiation.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Demonstrate ISRU for propellant production on Mars.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Conduct human relevant EDL demonstration.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>Besides the scientific outcomes of the mission, which will be of tremendous value to human missions, one of the most important contributions of Ice Dragon will be demonstration of the EDL capabilities of the Red Dragon capsule.</p>
