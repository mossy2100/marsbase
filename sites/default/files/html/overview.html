<p>If settlement of Mars is our primary goal rather than purely &ldquo;flags and footprints&rdquo; exploration, scientific research or political oneupmanship, then conducting a series of distinct missions to disparate locations on Mars makes less sense. If we&rsquo;re going to Mars to stay, a superior strategy is to build up infrastructure in one location and establish PHP-M as quickly as possible. This is referred to as a &ldquo;base-first&rdquo; strategy (Gage, 2010).</p>

<p>Once a Mars base is established we&rsquo;ll be better positioned to conduct whatever further science and exploration is desired, as expeditions can be launched from the base rather than from Earth. This will be more efficient, cheaper, and much more convenient.</p>

<p>For this reason, Blue Dragon is designed as a series of missions to one particular location on Mars. The intention is to progressively build up infrastructure and technological capability at this location, establishing a base that can support multiple missions and be developed to a point where it can support a human presence more-or-less indefinitely. This is the International Mars Research Station (IMRS).</p>

<p>As the name suggests, the IMRS draws on the legacy of both the International Space Station (ISS) and the Mars Analog Research Station (MARS) program.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The International Space Station</h3>

<p>The ISS is a triumph of space engineering and international collaboration, and is one of the greatest success stories in the history of space development. It is the most expensive artefact ever constructed, with an estimated total cost of US$150 billion. This high cost is one of the reasons why an international partnership has been helpful, as it spreads the cost across multiple governments.</p>

<p>It has also been profoundly important for encouraging and developing international cooperation in space. Cooperation in space is especially important because it involves cutting-edge technologies that may have military applications. Therefore, cooperation between nations participating in the ISS indicates a high level of trust between nations.</p>

<p>The ISS continues to benefit people all over the world, and not only the participating nations. It is a beacon of inspiration and achievement at the forefront of human expansion into space. Because the Blue Dragon program is designed to be international, for the reasons discussed, it makes sense to continue building on the collaboration framework already developed for the ISS.</p>

<h3>Mars Analog Research Stations</h3>

<p>For some years the Mars Society has conducted a program to build and operate several MARS&rsquo;s (Mars Analog Research Stations). To date, two operational MARS&rsquo;s have been constructed and are in active use:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		<p>FMARS (Flashline Mars Arctic Research Station), located at Haughton Crater on Devon Island in the Canadian arctic.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>MDRS (Mars Desert Research Station), located near Hanksville in Utah, USA.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>A third station, MARS-OZ (Australian Mars Analog Research Station) is planned for the Lake Frome Plains east of Arkaroola in South Australia, possibly to be constructed within the next 1-2 years.</p>

<p>The MARS program has been enormously successful. To date, 14 simulated missions have been operated at FMARS and more than 100 at MDRS. Mission durations range from weeks to months. The season during which FMARS operates is much shorter than that for MDRS, being located in a far more extreme and less accessible environment.</p>

<p>An ambitious 365-day simulated mission to FMARS, called MA365 (Mars Arctic 365), has begun. Phase 1 of MA365, a refurbishment mission, has already been completed. Phase 2 and the full 365-day simulation will commence in July 2014.</p>

<p>Through the MARS program, research has been conducted by the Mars Society as well as various space agencies, universities and independent researchers into almost every aspect of the surface element of H2M missions. This includes EHA (Extra-Habitat Activity); geological and biological research; marssuit and airlock design; habitat layout and operation; recycling and resource management; psychology and human factors; art; construction and building materials; food preparation and production; command, control and communications; surface mobility and robotics; navigation; scheduling and rostering; and much more.</p>

<p>Crews who have been involved in simulations at FMARS and MDRS invariably speak highly of the experience. One of the more interesting factors is the reuse of a habitat that contains the imprints of previous crews - signatures and inspirational quotes, photographs, furniture, musical instruments, cooking equipment, and the countless iterative tweaks and refinements to improve the interior environment and make it progressively safer and more agreeable as a living space. This is also a desirable feature for the IMRS.</p>
