<p>The entire architecture relies on chemical propulsion due to its high TRL. In addition, most of the propulsion systems use methalox (LOX/LCH4) bipropellant, for reasons described below.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><b>Earth surface to orbit</b></h2>

<p>The current rocket engines used by SpaceX, and in many other modern rockets, use LOX/RP-1 as propellant. However, as mentioned, SpaceX are currently developing a methalox (LOX/LCH4) rocket engine called <i>Raptor</i> that will power the second and upper stages of the next generation Falcon Heavy rockets. They may also be used in SpaceX&rsquo;s Mars Colonial Transport.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><b>In space (between the orbits of Earth and Mars)</b></h2>

<h3><b>Chemical vs. NTR</b></h3>

<p>The DRA describes two main options for in-space propulsion: NTR&rsquo;s (Nuclear Thermal Rockets) and chemical propulsion. The <i>Blue Dragon</i> architecture specifically favours chemical propulsion.</p>

<p>Chemical propulsion has a high TRL, is comparatively much cheaper and better understood than NTR&rsquo;s, and a wide range of engines are already available. One of the salient features of <i>Blue Dragon</i> is its low cost, and chemical propulsion is in alignment with that.</p>

<p>The primary benefit of NTR&rsquo;s is that they provide a thrust around twice that of any chemical propulsion system. However, they would be much more expensive to develop, as the TRL is very low. No NTR engine has ever flown. The NERVA program flight tested several NTR components; however, that program closed in 1972, which is over four decades ago at the time of writing. Project Timberwind and the Space Thermal Nuclear Propulsion program conducted further research into NTR&rsquo;s, however, failed to research their objective of flight testing an NTR upper stage, and the program was closed in 1994 (two decades ago at the time of writing).</p>

<p>An NTR includes an unshielded nuclear fission reactor, which is assuredly a dangerous piece of equipment. In the event of failure, the entire spacecraft including the crew would be exposed to high levels of radiation far more harmful than GCR. If the spacecraft exploded in the atmosphere, toxic nuclear radiation products may be distributed over a wide area. For this reason it may be difficult to gain public support for their use; in fact, public opposition would be more likely.</p>

<p>The use of NTR&rsquo;s in near-term Mars missions is therefore a long shot at best. They would take much longer and cost more to develop, may be difficult to get approved, and are much more dangerous and completely unnecessary. In addition, most NTR&rsquo;s use hydrogen as the working fluid, and, as is discussed in the next section, long-term cryogenic storage of liquid hydrogen is also impractical for this architecture.</p>

<p>Exotic propulsion systems that reduce the time and cost involved in getting to Mars will indeed be beneficial for future missions, and will certainly be an important part of our future expansion into the Solar System. However, just as ships were perfectly adequate for European expansion, without any need to wait for airplanes to be invented, chemical propulsion is available now and is perfectly capable of transporting crew and cargo safely to Mars. A 6-month flight to Mars is comparable to the 6 months it took for an ocean voyage from England to Australia in the 18<sup>th</sup> century, and arguably much safer, as the crew will be living an environment-controlled conditions with plenty of good food and water, and continuous communications with their home port.</p>

<p>At this stage other exotic propulsion methods such as ion propulsion, VASIMR, plasma thrusters, field propulsion, etc., are not under consideration for use in the <i>Blue Dragon</i> architecture, as they are not needed. However, that may change, if these things are developed and become superior in terms of cost, safety and performance.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><b>LOX/LH2</b></h3>

<p>Many chemical propulsion systems designed for interplanetary transport use LOX/LH2 as propellant, for two main reasons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>High specific impulse</li>
	<li>Availability of existing engines</li>
</ul>

<p>The chemical propulsion version of the transportation systems described in the DRA currently specify RL10B-2 engines from Pratt and Whitney Rocketdyne for the MTV, which use LOX/LH2. However, for <i>Adeona</i>, or any Mars mission, LOX/LH2 is probably not an ideal choice.</p>

<p>Hydrogen is notoriously difficult to store for long periods in space, especially in the vacuum of space. Because of the very small molecule size, it leaks away, or &ldquo;boils off&rdquo;. A typical boil-off rate for hydrogen in space is about 3.8% per month. Even if this can be reduced to, say, 2%, via advancements in H2 storage over the next 20 years, it would <i>still</i> be necessary for <i>Adeona</i> arrive at Mars with a surplus of 44% of the fuel necessary to get back. If the boil-off rate can be reduced to 1%, the surplus fuel to account for 1.5 years is still a fairly high 20%.</p>

<p>Note that these calculations only account for the H2 losses that would be incurred during the wait on orbit. Additional H2 would also boil off during the 6-month trips to and from Mars.</p>

<p>This is not the only reason why hydrogen is an unattractive option. Because of its low density, LH2 requires larger storage tanks compared with other fuels, and the necessary tank size becomes yet larger when accounting for the boil-off margin. Larger tanks are obviously heavier, and therefore much more expensive to launch. These drawbacks outweigh any advantages of LH2.</p>

<p>The evolution of nanostructured materials holds much promise for space exploration, as it will soon be possible to manufacture spacecraft components that are have all the desired mechanical properties, yet are orders of magnitude lighter. However, due to the small molecule size of LH2, it remains to be seen to what degree advancements in this area will benefit hydrogen storage. As shown, even if boil-off rate can be reduced to 1%, the necessary margin is still non-trivial. Using a fuel with a larger molecule size will enable us to take better advantage of nanostructured materials and construct very strong yet lightweight tanks that will not leak at all.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><b>Methalox</b></h3>

<p>Instead of LOX/LH2 it may be preferable to use a storable bipropellant such as mono-methyl hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide, as used by SpaceX&rsquo;s SuperDraco engines. However, a more suitable option is almost certainly methalox.</p>

<p>As settlement of Mars and the Solar System progresses, methalox engines will probably become increasingly common, at least while chemical propulsion remains economical. Methalox offers a range of important advantages as a bipropellant:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<p><b>Availability, low cost, and potential for ISPP.</b> Methane and oxygen can be easily obtained or manufactured from resources abundantly available throughout the Universe. On Earth, methane can be obtained directly from natural gas, and oxygen directly from the atmosphere. On Mars, both can be easily manufactured from readily available CO2 and H2O. Many asteroids are abundant in carbon and water from which methalox can be manufactured. Titan may even have lakes of liquid methane.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>
		<p><b>Commonality of hardware elements.</b> Because methalox is planned for the MAV, if the same basic engine type is used for the MTV then redundancy is automatically built into our knowledge base. Propulsion engineers working on both vehicles will be able to share expertise, resulting in greater synergy and problem-solving capability. As methalox engines become more common and studied by more people, new ways to optimise them will emerge. This commonality may also simplify the mission by reducing the number of component types.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>
		<p>Methane is <b>non-toxic</b>, unlike some other rocket fuels.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>
		<p><b>Better than RP-1.</b> Methane has various advantages over RP-1 (Rocket Propellant-1). It&rsquo;s cheaper, has a slightly better specific impulse, and is not subject to coking. Methane can also be run less O2-rich, which is easier on the pumps.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><b>Better than LH2.</b> Methane is considerably easier to work with than hydrogen. In other cases LH2 has won out over LCH4 due to its much higher specific impulse (450s vs. methane&rsquo;s 380s). However, for many reasons methane is preferable:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>Methane can be kept cryogenic using passive cooling, unlike hydrogen, which requires active cooling.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Liquid methane has a much higher density than liquid hydrogen (420kg/m<sup>3</sup> compared with 70kg/m<sup>3</sup>) and thus smaller tanks are required for the same mission. This reduces mass, cost, and the amount of fuel required.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Methane is easier to work with than hydrogen. Methane&rsquo;s boiling point is 110K, compared with hydrogen&rsquo;s 20K. This means fuel lines can be purged with ordinary gaseous nitrogen. Liquid hydrogen lines can only be purged with helium.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>As discussed, hydrogen is subject to boil-off.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Hydrogen causes metal to become brittle, therefore, hydrogen-based engines and tankage requires advanced metallurgy, which drives up the cost of the vehicle.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Hydrogen can cause invisible high-temperature fires.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2><b>Landing crew capsules</b></h2>

<p>The Dragon V2 capsules include eight SuperDraco engines, which use a hypergolic storable propellant: mono-methyl hydrazine as fuel and nitrogen tetroxide as oxidiser. The same propellant can be used on Mars and Earth. Of course, it&rsquo;s likely that there will be some evolution in the Dragon capsules, and capsule technology generally, during the next two decades.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><b>Landing the MAV and Surface Hab</b></h2>

<p>The DRA goes into some detail about how masses of this scale (20+ tonnes) can be landed on Mars, with the following conclusion:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p><i>The reference EDL architecture that was ultimately selected for this study was a hypersonic aeroassist entry system, with a mid lift-to-drag ratio (L/D) aeroshell that was ejected at low supersonic Mach numbers. An LOX/LCH4-fuelled propulsion system was used for deorbit delta-V maneuvers, RCS control during the entry phase, and final terminal descent to the surface.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, the DRA proposes a methalox engine for landing large items on Mars, and <i>Blue Dragon</i> adopts this recommendation. Using methalox engines for ascent, descent and in-space propulsion carries numerous benefits, as discussed, primarily related to commonality of hardware and the advantages of methalox as a bipropellant.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><b>Mars surface to orbit</b></h2>

<p>The MAV&rsquo;s ascent stage carries the crew from Mars surface to orbit. These will use methalox bipropellant produced from local Martian resources, as described in the section on ISPP.</p>

<p>The necessary methalox engines to be used in the MAV are yet to be developed. However, development of the new Raptor engine, in addition to new methalox engines developed for in-space propulsion, will be instructive in designing engines for the MAV.</p>
