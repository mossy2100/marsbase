<p>In order to maintain the health of the crew for the full duration of the mission, we require specific life support consumables such as air, water and food. In addition, fuel is required for the trip to Mars and back.</p>

<p>The intention here is not to calculate exact amounts of resources required, as this has been done before in the DRA and elsewhere [HANFORD]. The intention here is merely to offer a number of ideas and strategies for obtaining and managing resources in a practical way.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Optimising resource usage</h2>

<p>In space missions we are effectively separate from the environment of Earth where resources are comparatively far more abundant. Therefore, they must be strictly conserved. In addition, the high cost of launching mass from the surface of Earth to space dictates that the amount of consumables must be minimised as much as possible; without, of course, compromising crew health and safety.</p>

<p>There are three main strategies for minimising the amount of consumables that need to be launched from Earth:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Rationing and rules</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recycling</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Situ Resource Utilisation</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Rationing and rules</h3>

<p>Rationing and other consumable conservation rules must be followed by the crew in order to control resource consumption below certain limits.</p>

<p>Rationing applies primarily to food and water, and simply means that a daily ration of each is calculated for each function (eating, drinking, washing, etc.), and the crew are required to strictly consume an amount equal to or less than their ration. In this way, a limited quantity of food and water can be made to last for the full duration of the mission. Naturally, a buffer is built into the supplies to allow some flexibility here when required (for example, additional food and water is required for EVA&rsquo;s).</p>

<p>Rules can also be implemented to conserve energy consumption. For example, not using computers or communications equipment during the night, when power cannot be drawn directly from solar panels but must be drawn from less efficient sources such as batteries or fuel cells.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Recycling</h3>

<p>This applies to water and air, and is the most effective strategy for reducing consumable requirements.</p>

<p>Almost all water consumed by the crew can be recovered from solid or liquid waste, and the habitat atmosphere. With modern spacecraft systems such as those found on the ISS, water can be recycled with an efficiency of 90% or greater; or in other words, the net loss of the consumable after recycling is effectively only about 10% or less of the amount consumed. This greatly reduces the amount of water required for the mission.</p>

<p>The efficiency with which air can be recycled depends largely on how CO2 is handled. In space it may simply be purged. On Mars it may be purged, or it could be recycled back into the ISAP system, which obtains oxygen from CO2.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>In Situ Resource Utilisation</h3>

<p>ISRU refers to making use of resources in space or at Mars rather than transporting them from Earth. Blue Dragon proposes producing bipropellant, water and breathable air from the local Martian environment.</p>

<p>Previous proposals for H2M architectures have been reasonably conservative in terms of inclusion of ISRU, either excluding it altogether, or including only ISPP. This is because provision and management of resources is in the critical path for the mission, and ISRU has not yet been demonstrated &ldquo;in the field&rdquo;, so to speak. However, because ISRU provides such a benefit in terms of reduction in launch mass and improved safety, it&rsquo;s worth including if it can be shown to be reliable.</p>

<p>Although ISRU is yet to be demonstrated at Mars, this problem can be addressed by sending one or more missions to Mars to do just that. A concept mission called &ldquo;Green Dragon&rdquo;, which is a Red Dragon capsule containing an integrated ISPP and ISWP system, would be a reasonably inexpensive method to achieve this. Although the cost of Green Dragon will be non-trivial, the benefits and ROI are substantial, as demonstration of, and experience with, Mars ISPP from locally obtained CO2 and H2O will be invaluable for future missions. Green Dragon is described briefly at the end of this document and will be discussed in more detail separately.</p>

<p>ISRU is valuable not only for reducing launch mass, but also for improving safety. To highlight this, consider a situation in which the crew is reliant on water transported from Earth:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>What if the amount of water required is underestimated, and they run out?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What if the recycling equipment malfunctions and cannot be repaired?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What if something causes the water to be lost? (e.g. a micrometeorite puncturing a tank)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What happens if the crew miss the return launch window for some reason and must stay on Mars for a further 26 months until they can attempt another launch?</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In all cases, if water can be manufactured from the local environment the crew will be better off, at least in terms of that resource. Of course, there are also risks associated with ISRU, such as, what if it doesn&rsquo;t work, or what if the equipment breaks down? However, once developed, tested and refined, ISRU technology ultimately results in a far more secure situation for the crew, and, in any case, is an essential capability to development for an ongoing process of settlement.</p>
