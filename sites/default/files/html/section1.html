<p>The DRA proposes a series of three missions to distinct locations on Mars
  over a period of a decade; in other words, a similar program to Apollo.
  However, if settlement of Mars is the primary goal, rather than purely
  exploration, scientific research or political oneupmanship, then an
  Apollo-style program makes less sense. If we’re going to Mars to stay, a
  superior strategy is to build up infrastructure in one location and establish
  PHP-M (Permanent Human Presence on Mars) as quickly as possible. This is
  referred to as a “base first” strategy.</p>

<p>Once a Mars base is established it will be easier to conduct whatever further
  science and exploration is desired, as expeditions can be launched from the
  base rather than from Earth. This will be more efficient, cheaper and much
  more convenient.</p>

<p>For this reason, the program outlined here describes a series of missions to
  one specific location on Mars. The intention is to progressively build up
  infrastructure and technological capability at this location, establishing a
  base that can support multiple missions and be developed to a point where it
  can support a human presence more-or-less indefinitely. This is the
  International Mars Research Station (IMRS).</p>

<h2><a id="section1-1"></a>1.1. Shoulders of Giants</h2>

<p>As the name suggests, the IMRS is largely inspired by, and draws on the
  legacy of, the ISS (International Space Station) and the MARS (Mars Analogue
  Research Station) programs. It also builds on the experience and knowledge
  garnered through visionary and pioneering space programs such as Apollo,
  SkyLab, Mir and others.</p>

<h3><a id="section1-1-1"></a>1.1.1. The International Space Station</h3>

<p>The ISS is a triumph of space engineering and international collaboration,
  and is one of the greatest success stories in the history of space
  development. A total of 75 missions have been conducted to the ISS, and it has
  been permanently inhabited for 14 years. It is also the most expensive
  artefact ever constructed, with an estimated total cost of US$150 billion.
  This high cost is one of the reasons why an international partnership has been
  helpful, as it spreads the cost across multiple countries.</p>

<p>The ISS has also been profoundly important for encouraging and developing
  peaceful international cooperation in space. This is important partly because
  it involves cutting-edge technologies that may have military applications;
  therefore, the collaborative relationships between ISS partners indicates a
  high level of trust.</p>

<p>The ISS continues to benefit people all over the world, not only the
  participating nations. It’s a beacon of inspiration and achievement at the
  forefront of human expansion into space. Because the IMRS is designed to be
  international, it makes sense to continue building on the collaboration
  framework already developed for the ISS.</p>

<h3><a id="section1-1-2"></a>1.1.2. Mars Analogue Research Stations</h3>

<p>For some years the Mars Society has conducted a program to build and operate
  several MARSes. To date, two operational MARSes have been constructed by the
  Mars Society and are in active use:</p>

<ol>
  <li>FMARS (Flashline Mars Arctic Research Station), located at Haughton Crater
    on Devon Island in the Canadian arctic.
  </li>
  <li>MDRS (Mars Desert Research Station), located near Hanksville in Utah, USA.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>NASA have also built a MARS on the slopes of the Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii
  called HI-SEAS (Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation).</p>

<p>Another, MARS-Oz (Australian Mars Analogue Research Station) is planned for
  the Lake Frome Plains east of Arkaroola in South Australia, possibly to be
  constructed within the next 1-2 years.</p>

<p>The MARS program has been enormously successful. To date, 14 simulated
  missions have been operated at FMARS and more than 150 at MDRS. Mission
  durations range from weeks to months. Although FMARS was constructed first,
  fewer missions have been conducted there due to its being located in a much
  more extreme and less accessible environment. It only operates during the
  summer, whereas MDRS is operated year-round.</p>

<p>The Mars Society has begun preparation for an ambitious 365-day simulated
  mission to FMARS, called MA365 (Mars Arctic 365). A refurbishment mission has
  already been completed, and the crew is currently being selected. The full
  365-day simulation will run from 2015-2016.</p>

<p>The Mars Society’s and NASA’s Mars analogue research programs have enabled
  them, as well as other space agencies and groups, universities and independent
  researchers, to gain deep insight into almost every aspect of the surface
  element of HMMs. This includes EVA; geological and biological research;
  marssuit and airlock design; habitat layout and operation; recycling and
  resource management; psychology and human factors; art and education;
  construction and building materials; food preparation and production; command,
  control and communications; surface mobility and robotics; navigation;
  scheduling and rostering; and much more.</p>

<p>Crews who have been involved in simulations at FMARS and MDRS invariably
  speak highly of the experience. One of the most interesting features is the
  reuse of a habitat that contains the imprints of previous crews - signatures
  and inspirational quotes, photographs, furniture, musical instruments, cooking
  equipment, and the countless tiny tweaks and refinements to improve the
  interior environment and make it progressively safer and more agreeable as a
  living space. This is one of the reasons for choosing to establish an outpost
  at a single location on Mars instead of exploring discrete locations.</p>

<h2><a id="section1-2"></a>1.2. Budget</h2>

<p>Cost is a major factor in any space venture, and in light of increasing
  pressure to allocate public money to more immediate issues, it has become an
  even more important consideration. NASA’s nominal benchmark for implementing
  the DRA is up to $100 billion for the full program lifecycle, including all
  development costs and three missions (Larson &amp; Pranke 1999). However, for
  the first three missions to the IMRS it should be possible to achieve a total
  cost well below this, for several reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The mission architecture is largely assembled from commercially-available
    (COTS) hardware components, which are considerably cheaper to purchase than
    it would be to develop custom-designed components.
  </li>
  <li>One of the major investments to enable humans-to-Mars missions is an SHLLV
    capable of delivering at least 20-30 tonne payloads to the surface of Mars.
    However, with the Space Launch System, Mars Colonial Transport, and Long
    March 9 all currently in development, a suitable vehicle should be
    available, and thus the cost of developing one does not need necessarily to
    be incorporated into the Mars program cost.
  </li>
  <li>All missions are to the same location, therefore major components such as
    the MTV (Mars Transfer Vehicle), SHAB (Surface HABitat), power systems,
    greenhouses, surface vehicles and so forth can be reused by multiple crews.
    The architecture is specifically organised for component reuse across
    multiple missions.
  </li>
  <li>As an international mission, some of the engineering, fabrication and
    other work can be done by countries where costs of labour, rent and other
    overheads are lower.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The goal should not be to do the cheapest possible HMM, as overly aggressive
  cost-cutting measures would compromise safety and results. The goal should be
  to do the smartest one, with the appropriate balance of cost, safety, and
  scientific, educational, industrial and economic ROI (Return On Investment).
  However, whatever else the architecture may be, it must be affordable. As was
  observed with the 90-Day Study, with its bottom line of $450 billion, an
  excessively high price tag simply makes the program nonviable.</p>

<p>By controlling costs while leveraging the latest technological and business
  innovations, combined with intelligent management, logistics and financing,
  the goal of sending humans to Mars is definitely within reach. Although
  further analysis is still necessary, with this architecture and an
  internationally collaborative approach it should be possible to implement a
  full program, including robotic precursor missions and three crewed surface
  missions, for well under $100 billion, and perhaps even less than half that
  amount.</p>

<p>For comparison, consider the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In 1990, the estimated cost of the Space Exploration Initiative, which
    included a permanent base on the Moon and human missions to Mars, was
    calculated at $400-$500 billion over 20-30 years (the 90-Day Study).
  </li>
  <li>The International Space Station had cost an estimated $150 billion by
    2010.
  </li>
  <li>NASA estimated the cost of “Mars Semi-Direct”, the architecture developed
    for the original Design Reference Mission, at $55 billion over 10 years.
  </li>
  <li>Dr Robert Zubrin estimated that Mars Direct would cost $30-$50 billion
    over 20 years for five missions, if implemented by NASA; but only $5 billion
    if implemented by private enterprise.
  </li>
  <li>Mars One estimate that the cost of the getting the first crew of four
    people to Mars will be $6 billion, including precursor missions.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For the purpose of this exercise, the cost of the first three missions,
  including precursor missions and hardware development, is estimated at $36
  billion. Although this is still very much a guess, it’s based on NASA’s
  estimate for the cost of the DRA, revised downwards to accommodate the cost
  reduction ideas incorporated into the plan.</p>

<p>This figure amounts to an average cost per mission of $12 billion, or $2
  billion per crew slot. This is an average of $100 million per crew slot, per
  year, for two decades (~2020-40), which should be affordable by the top
  space-faring nations. Note, however, that the bulk of this expenditure will be
  required during the initial 20-year period of preparation and development, and
  securing financial commitment from all partners for this will be a
  challenge.</p>

<p>The intention is to run more than three missions. Consider that 75 missions
  have been run to the ISS so far. Because $150 billion was spent on
  constructing the space station, naturally the partners have sought to get
  their money’s worth. The same logic applies to the IMRS, and the longer-term
  goal would be to invest on the order of $100 billion and run at least 10
  missions. This will take about 33 years (2020-2053), during which time both
  architecture and base will evolve as a result of new discoveries and
  technological innovation.</p>

<p>The reason for making an estimate for first three missions, rather than 10,
  is for comparison with the DRA, of which Blue Dragon is an evolution.</p>

<br/>

<p class="indent2"><i>The proper goal of a human Mars mission program should be
  sustained exploration followed by settlement. This can only be done if costs
  are kept low.</i><br/>- Dr Robert Zubrin</p>

<h2><a id="section1-3"></a>1.3. International Partnership</h2>

<p>It is the intention that the IMRS be developed as a true international
  collaboration, for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To reduce the financial burden on any one nation.</li>
  <li>To open up Mars for all humanity rather than only one nation, race or
    ideology.
  </li>
  <li>To improve international relations by further developing trust,
    communication and cooperation between the world’s major powers, thereby
    helping to bring about world peace.
  </li>
  <li>To take advantage of the people, facilities, hardware, technology, data,
    knowledge and other resources available in many countries instead of just
    one.
  </li>
  <li>To gain greater leverage from the research, expertise, designs and
    philosophies of the most talented scientists, engineers, managers and others
    from all over Earth, thus advancing space technology further and more
    quickly, reducing costs, benefiting Earth and all humanity, and increasing
    the overall value of the project’s outcomes.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Sharing the cost</h4>

<p>The IMRS plan is made yet more viable by distributing the cost across a
  consortium of multiple space agencies in a similar fashion to the ISS.</p>

<p>Because the economies of the participating nations are quite different, and
  because $100 million per year would represent a fairly significant fraction of
  some space agency budgets, it’s possible that investment could be made
  partially or wholly “in kind” rather than “in cash”. For example, a space
  agency may contribute an equivalent value in engineering, launch services,
  hardware or facilities.</p>

<p>It is hoped and expected that future missions will be progressively cheaper,
  and many other nations, perhaps even those that don’t yet have a HSF (Human
  Space Flight) program, will eventually also be able to send astronauts to
  Mars.</p>

<h3><a id="section1-3-1"></a>1.3.1. Expanding the ISS Partnership</h3>

<p>The ISS has been a huge success in terms of scientific research as well as
  international collaboration in outer space. The ISS partnership of five
  leading space agencies provides an excellent basis for expansion into a larger
  partnership for development of the IMRS.</p>

<p>The five ISS partners are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>NASA</li>
  <li>Roscosmos (Russian Federal Space Agency)</li>
  <li>ESA (European Space Agency)</li>
  <li>JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency)</li>
  <li>CSA (Canadian Space Agency)</li>
</ol>

<p>These countries are represented by flags in the upper half of the IMRS emblem
  (see <a href="/the-imrs#section1-3-3">The IMRS Emblem</a>).</p>

<p>The proposed new partners are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>AEB (Agência Espacial Brasileira/Brazilian Space Agency)</li>
  <li>ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation)</li>
  <li>KARI (Korea Aerospace Research Institute)</li>
  <li>CNSA (China National Space Agency)</li>
  <li>SSAU (State Space Agency of Ukraine)</li>
</ol>

<p>These countries are represented by flags in the lower half of the IMRS
  emblem.</p>

<p>Brazil is a bilateral partner with NASA in the ISS, developing flight
  equipment and payloads in return for access to ISS facilities and flight
  opportunities for Brazilian astronauts. With this established relationship
  with the ISS, they should be included in the IMRS program. </p>

<p>The space agencies of South Korea and India expressed their desire to join
  the ISS in 2009, and talks commenced in 2010. Although this goal has not yet
  been realised, these are nonetheless leading agencies and should be included
  in the IMRS partnership. Both nations have their own astronauts and rockets,
  and India recently became the first Asian nation to reach Mars orbit.</p>

<p>China operate their own independent space station (Tiangong), and, along with
  the US and Russia, are one of only three nations with human spaceflight and
  lunar soft-landing capability. They are currently building one of the largest
  rockets ever conceived — the Long March 9 — and have plans for human missions
  to the Moon and Mars. They are one of the world’s leading space agencies and
  should definitely be included in the IMRS.</p>

<p>When interviewed in 2010, then ESA Director-General Jean-Jacques Dordain said
  his agency was ready to propose to NASA and the other space station partners
  that China, India and South Korea be invited to join the station partnership,
  saying: “These three nations have been active in the multilateral discussion
  of future space exploration architecture. It seems that these three would be a
  good place to start widening the partnership.” (Selding 2010).</p>

<p>Ukraine have their own astronauts and launch vehicles, and plans for lunar
  exploration and development of advanced space technology. SSAU are one of the
  top 10 government space agencies in terms of funding (excluding European
  agencies other than ESA), and are currently engaged in a joint venture with
  AEB to develop new launch facilities in Brazil. They are also a member of
  ISECG (International Space Exploration Coordinating Group — see below). It
  will be highly advantageous to include Ukraine in the IMRS partnership.</p>

<h4>The International Space Exploration Coordinating Group</h4>

<p>In 2007, as a response to a report titled “The Global Exploration Strategy —
  The Framework for Coordination,” (Global Exploration Strategy 2007) the ISECG
  was formed from a consortium of 14 space agencies:</p>

<ol>
  <li>ASI (Agenzia Spaziale Italiana/Italian Space Agency)</li>
  <li>CNES (Centre national d’études spatiales/National Centre for Space
    Studies) (France)
  </li>
  <li>CNSA</li>
  <li>CSA</li>
  <li>CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation)
    (Australia)
  </li>
  <li>DLR (Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt/German Aerospace Center)
  </li>
  <li>ESA</li>
  <li>ISRO</li>
  <li>JAXA</li>
  <li>KARI</li>
  <li>NASA</li>
  <li>SSAU</li>
  <li>Roscosmos</li>
  <li>UKSA (United Kingdom Space Agency)</li>
</ol>

<p>Assuming that the space agencies of Italy, France, Germany and the UK will be
  represented by ESA in the IMRS partnership (as they are in the ISS), there’s
  almost a total overlap between this list and the 10 space agencies above,
  suggesting that the IMRS could potentially be developed in conjunction with
  ISECG.</p>

<p>AEB is not yet part of ISECG, although considering its history of
  collaboration with NASA and SSAU, and involvement with the ISS, perhaps it
  should be. CSIRO is not listed as an IMRS partner mainly because it doesn’t
  have a human spaceflight program; however, CSIRO could certainly participate
  in space science and engineering aspects of the IMRS. (Naturally it’s the
  author’s hope that Australia will revise its feeble space policy and establish
  a well-funded Australian Space Agency actively involved in human spaceflight
  and interplanetary exploration, giving it the credibility to be a full IMRS
  partner. One can dream.) </p>

<br/>

<p class="indent2"><i>Several nations can afford to send their own robotic
  exploration missions to Mars but there are significant benefits in
  coordinating these national efforts and future human exploration missions.</i><br/>-
  Global Exploration Strategy</p>

<h4>Space is for peace</h4>

<p>At this time in history it may be difficult to imagine some of the IMRS
  nations collaborating in space; or, for that matter, anything else. However,
  in addition to the myriad other benefits of space exploration, collaboration
  in space has proven an effective peacemaker. The US and USSR competed in the
  space arena for 20 years before commencing a long period of cooperation, to
  the point where, for a period, the US relied on Russian spacecraft to ferry
  its astronauts to and from the ISS. In fact, the two nations were cooperating
  in space long before the end of the Cold War in 1991. Three decades earlier,
  in 1961, John F Kennedy said “Let both sides seek to invoke the wonders of
  science instead of its terrors. Together let us explore the stars.” Talks
  began about US-Soviet collaboration in space, and in 1975, the Apollo-Soyuz
  Test Program, which developed compatible docking systems, signified the
  beginning of a long period of collaboration between the two superpowers.</p>

<p>Perhaps because activities in space take place above the surface of the
  Earth, they also seems to be above its petty squabbles. Space is inspiring and
  transcendent, and virtually all who work in the field have a tacit
  understanding that expansion into space represents a solution to many human
  problems. Astronauts, scientists and others involved in space exploration seem
  to be aware, at least at some level, that they are working to create a future
  in which international conflict has ended and humanity expands into the cosmos
  as a united family.</p>

<p>Although there may be geopolitical tensions currently present on Earth, by
  setting the intention to create a truly international Mars program and
  establishing a framework for collaboration on Mars settlement for the benefit
  of all humanity, those tensions can be eased and ultimately eliminated. The
  result will be a foundation for greater global unity and a positive, abundant
  human future.</p>

<p>Astronaut Ron Garan expresses this sentiment well:</p>

<blockquote>I found myself looking down at the enormous International Space
  Station, one hundred feet below me, against the backdrop of our indescribably
  beautiful planet 240 miles below. The sheer beauty of the scene took my breath
  away— but even more compelling than the beauty was the realization of the
  tremendous human achievement that the International Space Station represents.
  It is not only an amazing technical accomplishment— probably the most complex
  structure ever constructed— but also one of the most amazing examples of
  international cooperation. As I hung there, looking down at the station
  against Earth, I marveled that fifteen nations, some that have not always been
  the best of friends, had found a way to set aside their differences and
  achieve something amazing in space. I wondered what the world would be like,
  and how many fewer problems we would all face, if we could figure out how to
  have the same level of cooperation and collaboration in our interactions on
  Earth’s surface.</blockquote>

<p>The purpose of the IMRS is therefore to achieve two great things at once;
  open up a new world for human civilisation while simultaneously bringing Earth
  to a condition of improved peace, abundance and environmental health. A key
  factor in achieving this is letting go of the “us and them” paradigm and
  realising that we’re one global family, and that national borders are illusory
  and obsolete. This truth becomes abundantly clear when viewing Earth from
  space, and is known as the “overview effect”.</p>

<p>Assertions are often made that various problems should be addressed on Earth
  before settlement of space. The truth is that expansion into space will
  greatly assist in solving virtually all of Earth’s major problems, through
  inspiration, knowledge, understanding, cooperation, technological evolution,
  and access to unlimited resources.</p>

<p>Human expansion into space will help to bring the people of the world
  together, and should therefore be done together.</p>

<h3><a id="section1-3-2"></a>1.3.2. Ten Partners</h3>

<p>If this ambitious collaboration can be achieved, the partnership will include
  10 agencies. A model for financial participation in the first three missions
  could be organised into three tiers based on the level of the agencies’
  funding. This would determine the number of astronauts each can send within
  the first three missions:</p>

<table id="crew-slots">
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <th class="head" rowspan="2" valign="middle">
      <h3>Level A</h3>

    <th>South Korea</th>
    <th>KARI</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Ukraine</th>
    <th>SSAU</th>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>At a cost of $100 million per crew slot per year for two decades, the total
  investment by “Level A” partners, with one astronaut on each mission, would
  therefore be approximately $6 billion each. The total investment by “Level B”
  partners would be about $4 billion each, and the total investment by “Level C”
  partners would be about $2 billion each.</p>

<h4>Crew slots</h4>

<p>All international partners will be represented by at least one astronaut.
  This will give each partner a greater stake in the program; a greater return
  on investment in terms of national pride, recognition, and enthusiasm for STEM
  (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) education; and first-hand
  experience of a human interplanetary mission.</p>

<p>In order to preserve the truly international nature of each crew, and to
  permit a larger international partnership with each participating space agency
  represented by at least one astronaut, each could be restricted to a maximum
  of one astronaut per mission.</p>

<p>Below is a potential crew slot schedule for the first three missions. Alfa
  Mission favours those nations who currently operate space stations, namely the
  five ISS partners plus China, as these countries have the most experience with
  HSF.</p>

<h4>Level D partners</h4>

<p>There are a number of other countries with space agencies that also have
  astronauts, including Bulgaria, Colombia, Indonesia, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico,
  Turkey and Vietnam. The goal should be to ultimately make flight opportunities
  to Mars available to all these nations, and indeed any others that commence
  astronaut programs in the meantime. With a minimum of 10 missions to Mars,
  slots could be found for astronauts from all these countries, which would
  generate a massive benefit for them, and for the world.</p>

<h3><a id="section1-3-3"></a>1.3.3. The IMRS Emblem</h3>

<p>The emblem for the IMRS depicts the planet Mars with 12 flags around it:</p>

<p>The 10 smaller flags represent the proposed partnership comprised of the
  world’s top 10 space-faring nations (considering Europe as a single nation for
  the purpose of this exercise). This includes the five nations who created the
  ISS (USA, Russia, Europe, Japan and Canada), which appear at the top, plus
  five new partners (Brazil, China, India, South Korea and Ukraine), shown at
  the bottom. All of these nations are capable of participating in the IMRS and
  sending their own astronauts to Mars.</p>

<p>The large flag at the right of the emblem is the red-green-blue tricolour,
  which is the generally-accepted flag of Mars. This flag flies atop FMARS. It
  was designed by Pascal Lee in 1999 and, like the Mars trilogy by Kim Stanley
  Robinson (<i>Red Mars</i>, <i>Green Mars</i>, <i>Blue Mars</i>), is inspired
  by the colours of a changing Mars during human habitation. Mars is currently
  red, due to the ubiquitous presence of iron oxide across its surface. As
  terraforming proceeds, plants will grow on Mars, causing it to become green.
  And, eventually, when liquid water flows on the surface to form lakes and
  seas, and the atmosphere has become oxygenated, it will be blue like Earth.
</p>

<p>The presence of the Mars flag in the emblem is intended to symbolise that the
  goal is not merely to visit Mars — i.e. this is not just a “flags and
  footprints” exercise — but to establish a new branch of human civilisation.
  This symbolism imbues the project with a much grander purpose that will help
  to inspire participants and supporters.</p>

<p>The large navy blue flag at the left of the emblem is the generally-accepted
  flag of Earth. It features the Blue Marble, a famous photograph of Earth taken
  by the crew of Apollo 17. Its role in the emblem is to symbolise that Mars is
  being explored, not by a single nation or even a group of nations, but as “the
  people of Earth”, unified, for the benefit of all humanity, and for Earth
  herself.</p>
