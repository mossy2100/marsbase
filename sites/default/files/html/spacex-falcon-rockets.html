<p>Space Exploration Technologies Corporation, more commonly known as <a href="http://spacex.com" target="_blank">SpaceX</a>, is one of the best known of these new companies. They&rsquo;re currently developing a new family of rockets called Falcon, powered by rocket engines of their own design called Merlin, which run on kerosone (RP-1). They&rsquo;re also currently working on a new methane-oxygen engine called Raptor, designed to be able to refuel on Mars.</p>

<p>The Falcon 9 rocket has flown 8 times successfully so far, and has an impressive schedule of launches in its upcoming manifest. One of the Falcon 9&rsquo;s most attractive features is its price, with a cost of only $135M per launch. It&rsquo;s also the first rocket to be designed entirely in the 21st century.</p>

<p>The Falcon 9 Heavy is currently in development and will start flying later this year (2014) or early next year. It is essentially a Falcon 9 with two additional boosters, and will be capable of delivering 53 tonnes of payload to LEO or 13 tonnes to the surface of Mars. This will make it the most powerful rocket available; the most powerful since the Saturn V, which carried astronauts to the Moon.</p>

<p>Following these will be the much larger, super-heavy-lift Falcon X rockets. These are being designed for Mars, which is the goal of SpaceX, but will be equally useful for heavy lifting to Earth orbit or the lunar surface. The Falcon X Heavy will be capable of delivering an impressive 125 tonnes to LEO or about 20-30 tonnes to the surface of Mars. Considering this is approximately the minimum mass of a surface habitat, this rocket will be a key enabler of human Mars missions.</p>

<p>NASA is also developing a comparable super-heavy-lift rocket called the Space Launch System, which will be capable of delivering 130 tonnes to orbit. It, too, is being developed for human Mars missions, although it will be capable of reaching the Moon, Earth-Moon Lagrange points, and Near Earth Asteroids.</p>

<p>In the architecture described here I have favoured the SpaceX rockets, as their processes and standards have led to a family of spacecraft that are significantly lower in price, yet higher quality than their competitors. It is possible that the Falcon X Heavy will be as good as the SLS, if not better, yet also cheaper, and affordability is a key feature of this architecture.</p>

<p>However, comparisons based on SpaceX&rsquo;s current prices are not representative of their future prices, as they&rsquo;ve begun making their rockets reusable (whereas the SLS is an expendable rocket like all rockets to date). The recent &ldquo;Grasshopper&rdquo; test showed a reusable first stage ascending to a height of several hundred metres and landing on its tail. According to SpaceX, making their rockets rapidly reusable will reduce the cost per kilogram of sending material into space by a factor of approximately 100. This will drastically reduce the cost of human Mars missions, enabling a much greater number of missions and making it possible for more nations and more people to be involved.</p>

<p>As will be discussed later the goal for the International Mars Research Station is to develop a consortium of 10 space agencies, obviously including NASA as a major partner. With NASA involved there may be significant pressure to utilise the SLS, and hence this aspect of the architecture may change, despite the higher price. However, using different vehicles to deliver hardware to Mars won&rsquo;t impact the basic architecture.</p>
