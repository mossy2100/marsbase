<p class="p1">It is proposed that timekeeping for the full duration of these missions is based on Martian <i>sols</i> rather than Terran <i>days</i>. The length of a Martian sol, about 24 hours and 40 minutes, is similar enough to a Terran day for the crew to adapt to. While on the surface of Mars the crew will live and work in harmony with this cycle, as this will be much easier and more energy-efficient than trying to implement an artificial diurnal cycle as we&rsquo;ll need to do elsewhere in the Universe.</p>

<p class="p1">By using sols instead of days on the outbound trip the crew can be spared any additional adaptation stresses on arrival at Mars on top of the need to adapt to Mars&rsquo; gravity. The clocks aboard <i>Adeona</i> will be synched to the diurnal cycle at IMRS.</p>

<p class="p1">For the return trip, the same rationale applies. By continuing to live in harmony with Mars&rsquo; cycle instead of Earth&rsquo;s, the crew will be spared the stress of adaptation to a shorter diurnal period while simultaneously readapting to microgravity. In addition, using the same clock from the start of the mission to the end is obviously simpler.</p>

<p class="p1">On arrival back at Earth the crew will need to readapt to the Terran day as well as Earth&rsquo;s comparatively high gravity, and this will indeed be a challenge for them. However, on Earth they have all the necessary medical personnel and equipment to support them in this transition, plus they&rsquo;ll be extraordinarily famous, which will probably make it all a little easier to bear.</p>

<p class="p1">Living on Mars time has been done before - mission planners working on the Mars Exploration Rover missions (<i>Spirit</i> and <i>Opportunity</i>) had special watches made that operated on Mars time, and therefore, despite being still firmly on <i>terra firma</i>, began each day 40 minutes later than the one before.</p>

<p class="p1">Here we have identified yet another great advantage of focusing on a single location: mission controllers can use clocks and watches synched with the diurnal cycle at IMRS; they won&rsquo;t need to use a different clock for each different location on Mars. This is particularly important if they choose to live and work on Mars time, like the MER mission controllers.</p>
