<p>The outbound and return journeys occur when Mars is at its closest approach to Earth, which occurs about every 26 months. This is known as the <em>Earth-Mars synodic period</em>. The trip duration can be further minimised by travelling in the right years.</p>

<p>Due to Mars&rsquo; elliptical orbit, every 15-16 years the distance between Mars and Earth at closest approach reaches a minimum. This is the beat period between Mars&rsquo; anomalistic year (the time from one perigee to the next) and the Earth-Mars synodic period, which could be called the <em>Mars anomalistic-synodic beat period</em>.</p>

<p>The next minimum in this cycle is in 2018, which is therefore a popular choice for a trip to Mars, especially since this also coincides with the solar minimum: a point in the 11-year solar cycle when solar activity is at a minimum and therefore risk of a CME is correspondingly lower. It is for these reasons that the <a href="http://www.inspirationmars.org/" target="_blank">Inspiration Mars</a> flyby mission is planned for 2018.</p>

<p>To minimise the amount of time spent in space and/or the amount of fuel required to get from Earth to Mars and back, we could fly the first crew out in 2018 and bring them back in 2020. However, this is unrealistically soon. The subsequent opportunity is more practical. Sending them in 2033 and bringing them back in 2035 will minimise the total amount of time they spend in space, while also allowing sufficient time to build support for the mission, develop the international partnership, improve the TRL of the hardware and run precursor missions.</p>

<p>Of course, we aren&rsquo;t constrained to use these launch windows - they are simply the most advantageous. Subsequent crews will require longer-duration space elements (assuming the same propulsion systems), for the next 15-16 years until the next minimum. However, the first human mission is the most risky, since we have the least experience, therefore we need it to be optimised for safety. This is why, for that mission, we choose the launch opportunity that will result in the shortest possible space element.</p>

<p>Therefore Alpha Crew will launch in 2033 (with predeployment in 2031), Bravo Crew will launch in 2035, Charlie Crew in 2037, and so on.</p>
