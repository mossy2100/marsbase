<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additional water is required on the surface of Mars for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Cooling marssuits during EVA. The maximum value [HANFORD] is 7.3kg/EVA.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Experiments; for example, ISFP. This amount is hard to estimate without a clear definition of the experiments.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><em>Adeona</em></h3>

<p>For the space element there will be no EVA, however, the crew will be exercising 1-2 hours per day to counteract the effects of &micro;g. We can count these hours as effectively equal to EVA in terms of exertion. Hence the daily potable water consumption is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3.909 + (2 * 0.24) = 4.389kg/p-d</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore the total water requirement per crew member per day is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>4.389 + 20.86 = 25.25kg/p-d</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Metabolic water production will be:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>0.345 + (2 * 0.016) = 0.377kg/p-d</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore the total received by the recycling system will be:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>25.25 + 0.377 = 25.63kg/p-d.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Assuming the recycling system has an efficiency of 90%, the amount of water recovered is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>25.63 * 0.9 = 23.07kg/p-d</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hence the total water loss per day is approximately:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>25.25 - 23.07 = 2.18kg/p-d</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For a 360 day space element and 6-person crew, this is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>4708.8kg</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We may wish to have in reserve as much as one week&rsquo;s worth of water, allowing up to one week to repair the water recycling system in the event of a malfunction. This would be:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>25.25 * 6 * 7 = 1060.5kg</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore the total amount of water we initially require in Adeona is about:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>4708.8 + 1060.5 = 5769.3kg</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unlike in the DRA, an additional quantity is not provided to allow for contingencies such as supporting the crew on orbit for an additional 26 months if they miss their launch window. It is assumed, for now, that the crew would prefer the additional 10m<sup>3</sup> habitable volume space over a spare 10t of water that should never be needed. This could change; the BA 330&rsquo;s have a reasonably large internal volume, and if the Transit Hab is launched on a Falcon Heavy, its mass budget of 53t may accommodate this much additional water.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Surface Hab</h3>

<p>For the surface element we estimate an average of 4 EHA&rsquo;s per person per week, with a maximum duration of 7 hours. This comes to an estimated maximum average of 4 hours EHA per day.</p>

<p>Hence the daily potable water consumption is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3.909 + (4 * 0.24) = 4.869kg/p-d</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Each EHA will require up to 7.3kg for marssuit cooling [LARSON]. This amount be lower for the MCP marssuit design, but will do for a first-order analysis. This gives an average of:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>4.17kg/p-d</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore the total water requirement per crew member per day is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>4.869 + 20.86 + 4.17 = 29.9kg/p-d</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Metabolic water production will be:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>0.345 + (4 * 0.016) = 0.409kg/p-d</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The total received by the recycling system will therefore be:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>29.9 + 0.409 = 30.3kg/p-d</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Assuming the recycling system has an efficiency of 90%, the amount of water recovered is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>30.3 * 0.9 = 27.27kg/p-d</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hence the total water loss per day is about:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>29.9 - 27.27 = 2.63kg/p-d</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For a 6-person crew this is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>15.78kg/d</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is, therefore, the minimum amount the ISWP system needs to provide to the Hab each day.</p>

<p>Again, we may wish to have in reserve as much as one week&rsquo;s worth of water, allowing up to one week to repair the water recycling system in the event of a malfunction. This would be:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>29.9 * 6 * 7 = 1255.8kg</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the minimum amount that the ISWP system must store in the Surface Hab&rsquo;s tanks before the crew arrive.</p>

<p>The value of 15.78kg/d is considerably higher than the 3.3kg/sol that the WAVAR (WAter Vapour Adsorption Reactor) device described by Grover et al. [GROVER], is designed to extract from the Martian atmosphere. A scaled-up WAVAR may be able to achieve this, and/or this amount may be reduced in several ways, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Develop marssuits that require less cooling water.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Go on EHA less often.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Restrict water usage for laundry.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use a higher-efficiency recycling system (~95%).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If a WAVAR-type device is not capable of providing the necessary water, there are several alternatives:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Use an AWESOM rover to collect ground water, as for the MAV. This approach is preferred for optimal water security.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Transport hydrogen from Earth, and combine with oxygen obtained from the atmosphere to provide water. If we aim to manufacture enough water to replace losses for 540 days (8521kg), plus a full week&rsquo;s reserve (1256kg), a total of 9777kg, the amount of hydrogen required is 1086kg (plus a margin to compensate for boil-off). This is the approach taken by the DRA, although the quantity of hydrogen is only 400kg.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>MAV</h3>

<p>As discussed in the section on ISPP, the amount of water needed by the MAV for the manufacture of propellant is 48.4 tonnes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>ISWP (In Situ Water Production)</h2>

<p>Based on current knowledge water can be obtained from three primary sources on Mars:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Atmosphere:</p>

    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        <p>Water vapour</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ground:</p>

    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        <p>Ice</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Hydrated minerals</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Each of these represents specific challenges.</p>

<p>The concentration of water in the atmosphere is very low. Atmospheric water may potentially be used to provide water to the Hab using a WAVAR device, which captures water from the Martian atmosphere by adsorption in zeolite 3A.</p>

<p>However, we need significantly more water for ISPP, as the intention is to use Martian hydrogen rather than hydrogen brought from Earth. It isn&rsquo;t practical to try to obtain this much water from the atmosphere, so the ISPP process incorporates a system called AWESOM.</p>

<p>The AWESOM rover traverses across the terrain, extracting water from the top layer of regolith. An RTG (Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator), like the one used in Curiosity, provides both heat and electrical energy. A standard RTG produces about 300W of electricity and 6kW of heat. These can be used in combination, with the electrical energy being used to produce microwave radiation and the heat used directly, to release water from the regolith without the need for scooping up and baking the soil. The frequency of the microwave radiation can be tuned to preferentially heat water molecules rather than dirt. As described in chapter 15 &ldquo;Resources on Mars&rdquo; of Larson and Pranke (1999), the rover would have a flexible skirt brushing the dirt, containing the water vapour, which would be condensed onto a cold surface and collected.</p>

<p>The ability to make use of Martian water is fundamental to the Blue Dragon architecture, which means it&rsquo;s important to locate the IMRS in a region where the water content is reasonably high, while still aiming for lower latitudes in order to simplify landing and to maximise solar power. The ground at the proposed location for the IMRS (discussed in the <a href="/location">Location</a> section) should ideally be at least 7-8% water by mass. It should also be reasonably flat, supporting autonomous water collection by a mobile robot.</p>

<p>If we estimate that the average water concentration of the regolith is at least 7% by mass, and that 80% of this can be extracted from the top decimetre of regolith by heat and microwave radiation, we can estimate the amount of regolith that needs to to be processed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>48.4 tonnes of H2O &divide; 80% &divide; 7% = 864.3 tonnes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The density of dry Martian soil is about 1400kg/m<sup>3</sup>. If the regolith contains 7% water, and assuming that the water doesn&rsquo;t displace the regolith in a given volume but rather occupies the space between grains, the density of this wet regolith should be about:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1400kg/m<sup>3</sup> &divide; 93% = 1505kg/m<sup>3</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The volume of regolith to process is therefore:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>864300kg &divide; 1505kg/m<sup>3</sup> = 574.3m<sup>3</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Assuming we can only extract water from the top decimetre of regolith, the area that must be covered by the rover is about:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>574.3m<sup>3</sup> &divide; 0.1m = 5743 m<sup>2</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the AWESOM rover has a 1-metre wide catchment, it must therefore traverse about 58 strips of 100 metres length (or cover a square about 76 metres on a side).</p>

<p>Specifying the same 20 month time constraint, AWESOM must collect 80kg of water per day, which requires covering about 10m<sup>2</sup> of terrain per day. It will be preferable to collect the water as rapidly as possible, for peace of mind, and also because H2 is needed before CH4 can be produced. The design goal will be to build the robot to be capable of carrying up to 80-100kg of water, and will return to the MAV to unload at the end of each sol, in order to avoid spending the Martian night with a full water tank, as it may freeze and rupture the tank.</p>

<p>Keeping water in a liquid form within the AWESOM rover will require heat. Some of the heat generated by the RTG can be directed into this function.</p>
