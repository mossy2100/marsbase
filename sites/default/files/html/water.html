<p><small>* Varies from 5.44kg/p-d in Hanford [HANFORD]; based on 3 x 200mL for rinsing personal shaker 3 times per day.<br />
	** Based on 5kg/event, 1 event/p-m. </small></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additional water is required on the surface of Mars for:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Cooling marssuits during EVA. The maximum value (taken from BVAD [HANFORD]) is 7.3kg/EVA.</li>
	<li>Experiments; for example, ISFP. This amount is hard to estimate without a clear definition of the experiments.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><b><i>Adeona</i></b></h2>

<p>For the space element there will be no EVA, however, the crew will be exercising 1-2 hours per day to counteract the effects of &micro;g. We can count these hours as effectively equal to EVA in terms of exertion. Hence the daily potable water consumption is:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>3.909 + (2 * 0.24) = 4.389kg/p-d</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Added to other water requirements, the total water requirement per crew member per day is:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>4.389 + 20.86 = 25.25kg/p-d</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Metabolic water production will be:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>0.345 + (2 * 0.016) = 0.377kg/p-d</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore the total received by the recycling system will be:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>25.25 + 0.377 = 25.63kg/p-d.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Assuming the recycling system has an efficiency of 90%, the amount of water recovered is:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>25.63 * 0.9 = 23.07kg/p-d</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hence the total water loss per day is approximately:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>25.25 - 23.07 = 2.18kg/p-d</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For a 360 day space element and 6-person crew, this is:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>4708.8kg</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We may wish to have in reserve as much as one week&rsquo;s worth of water, allowing up to one week to repair the water recycling system in the event of a malfunction. This would be:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>25.25 * 6 * 7 = 1060.5kg</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore the total amount of water we initially require in <i>Adeona</i> is about:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>4708.8 + 1060.5 = 5769.3kg</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unlike in the DRA, an additional quantity is not provided to allow for contingencies such as supporting the crew on orbit for an additional 26 months if they miss their launch window. It is assumed, for now, that the crew would prefer the additional 10m<sup>3</sup> habitable volume space over a spare 10t of water that should never be needed. This could change; the BA 330&rsquo;s have a reasonably large internal volume, and if the Transit Hab is launched on a Falcon Heavy, its mass budget of 53t may accommodate this much additional water.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><b>Surface Hab</b></h2>

<p>For the surface element we estimate an average of 4 EHA&rsquo;s per person per week, with a maximum duration of 7 hours. This comes to an estimated maximum average of 4 hours EHA per day.</p>

<p>Hence the daily potable water allowance is:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>3.909 + (4 * 0.24) = 4.869kg/p-d</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Each EHA will require up to 7.3kg for marssuit cooling. This amount may be lower for the MCP marssuit design, but will do for a first-order analysis. This gives an average of:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>4.17kg/p-d</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore the total water requirement per crew member per day is:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>4.869 + 20.86 + 4.17 = 29.9kg/p-d</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Metabolic water production will be:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>0.345 + (4 * 0.016) = 0.409kg/p-d</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The total received by the recycling system will therefore be:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>29.9 + 0.409 = 30.3kg/p-d</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Assuming the recycling system has an efficiency of 90%, the amount of water recovered is:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>30.3 * 0.9 = 27.27kg/p-d</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hence the total water loss per day is about:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>29.9 - 27.27 = 2.63kg/p-d</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For a 6-person crew this is:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>15.78kg/d</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is, therefore, the minimum amount the ISWP system needs to provide to the Hab each day.</p>

<p>Again, we may wish to have in reserve as much as one week&rsquo;s worth of water, allowing up to one week to repair the water recycling system in the event of a malfunction. This would be:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>29.9 * 6 * 7 = 1255.8kg</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the minimum amount that the ISWP system must store in the Surface Hab&rsquo;s tanks before the crew arrive.</p>

<p>The value of 15.78kg/d is considerably higher than could reasonable be extracted from the atmosphere. This amount could perhaps be reduced in several ways, such as:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Develop marssuits that require less cooling water.</li>
	<li>Go on EHA less often.</li>
	<li>Restrict water usage for laundry.</li>
	<li>Use a higher-efficiency recycling system (~95%).</li>
</ul>

<p>If the necessary water cannot be obtained from the atmosphere, there are several alternatives:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Use an AWESOM rover to collect ground water, as for the MAV. This approach is preferred for optimal water security.</li>
	<li>Transport hydrogen from Earth, and combine with oxygen obtained from the atmosphere to provide water. If we aim to manufacture enough water to replace losses for 540 days (8521kg), plus a full week&rsquo;s reserve (1256kg), a total of 9777kg, the amount of hydrogen required is 1086kg (plus a margin to compensate for boil-off). This is the approach taken by the DRA, although the quantity of hydrogen is only 400kg.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><b>MAV</b></h2>

<p>The MAV needs water in order to manufacture the required methalox to launch from Mars and reach LMO. This will need to be obtained from the ground. As discussed in the section on ISPP (see <i>Propellant</i>), the quantity required is too large to be obtained from the atmosphere; therefore, we must obtain it from the ground. This is described below.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><b>ISWP (In Situ Water Production)</b></h2>

<p>Although making use of Martian water is a feature of the <i>Blue Dragon</i> architecture, the architecture is not reliant on this requirement. If it&rsquo;s deemed too risky to rely on extraction of local Martian water then the architecture can easily be modified such that H2 is brought from Earth instead, without affecting the core structure of the architecture. The plan presented here, however, is to obtain and use local Martian water. Although a non-trivial technical challenge, it is without question an achievable one for 21<span><sup>st</sup></span> century engineers with the technologies we have available now and that will become available within the next 10-20 years. Transporting hydrogen (a notoriously problematic substance) across 100Gm of interplanetary space to a world where hydrogen is abundant is really rather pointless. Assuming the settlement of Mars is our goal, sooner or later the capability to extract water from Mars will be developed; therefore, since we need it now, we may as well develop it now. The intention, therefore, is to run precursor missions (refer to <a href="/green-dragon">Green Dragon</a>) to test and develop the necessary ISWP equipment before running human missions.</p>

<p>This section describes methods for obtaining water from the Martian environment. Based on current knowledge water can be obtained from three primary sources on Mars:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Atmosphere</li>
	<li>Ground
		<ol type='a'>
			<li>Ice</li>
			<li>Hydrated minerals</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>Each of these represents specific challenges.</p>

<p>The concentration of water in the atmosphere is very low. Atmospheric water may potentially be used to provide water to the Hab using a device that captures water from the Martian atmosphere by adsorption in zeolite 3A.</p>

<p>However, we need significantly more water for ISPP, as the intention is to use Martian hydrogen rather than H2 brought from Earth. It isn&rsquo;t practical to try to obtain this much water from the atmosphere, so the ISPP process incorporates a system called AWESOM, which extracts water from the regolith.</p>

<p>In order to reduce the risk associated with reliance on local water, it&rsquo;s important to locate the IMRS in a region where the water content is reasonably high, ideally close to patch of ice or even a frozen lake. High ground water concentration implies high latitude; however, lower latitudes are preferred for other reasons, such as a simpler landing, more heat and sunlight (thus lower energy requirements), and improved visibility from MCOS (the areostationary satellite). Selecting a suitable location (see the <i>Location</i> section) requires balancing of these parameters.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><b>AWESOM (Autonomous Water Extraction from the Surface Of Mars)</b></h3>

<p>The core component of the AWESOM system is a mobile robot. The AWESOM robot traverses the nearby terrain, extracting water from the top layer of regolith. An SRG (Stirling Radioisotope Generator) provides both heat and electrical energy. These can be used in combination, with the electrical energy being used to produce microwave radiation and heat applied directly to release water from the regolith without the need for scooping up and baking the soil. The frequency of the microwave radiation can be tuned to preferentially heat water molecules rather than dirt. As described in chapter 15 of &ldquo;Resources on Mars&rdquo; by Larson and Pranke (1999) [LARSON], the rover would have a flexible skirt brushing the dirt, containing the water vapour, which would be condensed onto a cold surface and thereby collected.</p>

<p><i>Curiosity</i> uses a plutonium-fuelled RTG (Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator) known as the MMRTG (Multi-Mission RTG), which produces about 125W of electricity (falling to 100W after 14 years) and about 2000W heat. While this could be a suitable power source for the AWESOM robot, an SRG will be preferable due to their much greater efficiency at producing electrical energy, able to produce four times as much electrical power from the same amount of fuel; thus, if the same amount of Pu (plutonium) is used in the AWESOM&rsquo;s SRG as in <i>Curiosity</i>&rsquo;s RTG, then it should produce about 500W of electricity. However, the AWESOM will be smaller, as it must fit in the base of the MAV. If half the Pu is used then the SRG should produce about 250W of electricity, in addition to about 2000W of heat. Further research is required to determine if this will be sufficient for water extraction from regolith.</p>

<p>The ground at the proposed location for the IMRS should be at least 7-8% water by mass, and ideally over 10%. It should also be reasonably flat, which will support autonomous water collection by the AWESOM robot. The robot will traverse the ground near the MAV each day, collecting water, and returning to the MAV at the end of each sol or whenever its tank is full to unload.</p>

<p>AWESOM will have a simple robotic arm for connecting a heated hose into a socket at the base of the MAV, and a pump to transfer the water. Since electricity for microwaves and motors will not be required while the water is being transferred, it will be wholly available to power the robotic arm, heated hose and pump during this process.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><b>Water for ISPP</b></h3>

<p>If we estimate that the average water concentration of the regolith is, on average, 7% by mass, and that 80% of this can be extracted from the top decimetre of regolith, we can estimate the amount of ground that needs to be covered.</p>

<p>As described in the ISPP section, the approximate amount of water required for ISPP is 16.2 tonnes. The mass of regolith is therefore:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>16.2t H2O &divide; 80% &divide; 7% = 289.3 tonnes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The density of dry Martian soil is about 1,400kg/m<sup>3</sup>>. If the regolith contains 7% water, and assuming that the water doesn&rsquo;t displace the regolith in a given volume but rather occupies the space between grains, the density of this wet regolith should be about:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>1,400kg/m<sup>3</sup> &divide; 93% = 1,505kg/m<sup>3</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The volume of regolith to process is therefore:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>289,300kg &divide; 1,505kg/m<sup>3</sup> = 192.2m<sup>3</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Assuming we can only extract water from the top decimetre of regolith, the area that must be covered by the rover is about:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>192.2m<sup>3</sup> &divide; 0.1m = 1,922m<sup>2</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Overall the estimated amount of water that could potentially be extracted per unit area is:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>16,200kg &divide; 1,922m<sup>2</sup> = 8.4kg/m<sup>2</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the AWESOM rover has a 1-metre wide catchment, it must therefore traverse about 20 strips of 100 metres length, or cover a square about 44 metres on a side.</p>

<p>Specifying an estimated time constraint of 600 days, AWESOM must collect 27kg of water per day on average, which requires covering about 3.2m<sup>2</sup> of terrain per day. In reality, the rover should be capable of collecting somewhat more than this, perhaps up to 35kg per day, to allow for variations in water concentration. The design goal will be to build the robot to be capable of carrying up to about 30-40kg of water, such that it can return to the MAV to unload at the end of each sol. This will reduce the energy cost of keeping the water in liquid phase during the night.</p>

<p>If a 30-40 litre tank is too large for the rover, and it can only carry up to, say, 20 litres, this simply means it must return to the MAV to unload twice per day. The important thing is that it is capable of mining a sufficient area of ground per day.</p>

<p>Keeping water in a liquid phase within the AWESOM&rsquo;s tank will require heat. Some of the heat generated by the SRG can be diverted for this function. The hose for transferring water from the AWESOM robot to the MAV or Hab&rsquo;s tank will also need to be heated, although it&rsquo;s probably simpler to use electricity for that purpose.</p>

<p>It is desirable to collect the necessary water for ISPP as rapidly as possible, mainly for the peace of mind that will come from knowing the MAV has fuel, but also because H2 is needed before CH4 can be produced.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><b>Water for the Surface Hab</b></h3>

<p>As calculated above, the Surface Hab requires about 16kg of water per day to compensate for efficiency losses in the recycling system. An equivalent AWESOM system could be included with the Hab as for the MAV. Even though the quantity of water required is less, it&rsquo;s cheaper and simpler to replicate a single, proven design. Surplus water is valuable for contingencies, &ldquo;treats&rdquo; such as cooked meals or extended bathing, and for making air. In addition, a spare AWESOM robot serves as a backup in case one breaks.</p>
