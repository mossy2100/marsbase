<p>This website presents a program of near-term, affordable and achievable missions to send international crews of six people to Mars and return them safely to Earth, while developing a base on Mars. This is designed as an initial step towards settlement. The concept for the base is the International Mars Research Station (IMRS), a shared facility to be developed by a partnership comprised of the world&rsquo;s leading space agencies, for use by <em>all</em> nations and peoples.</p>

<p>This plan is based on a modern, practical, safe and affordable architecture for human Mars missions called &ldquo;Blue Dragon&rdquo;, which makes use of the latest advancements in space technology. This architecture has been developed as an evolution of the <a href="/nasa-design-reference-architecture">NASA Design Reference Architecture 5.0</a>&nbsp;[MASG], incorporating a number of innovations designed to reduce costs and to improve safety, the probability of success, and the overall benefit to humanity.</p>

<p>The primary difference from the DRA is the choice to focus on a single location rather than several, thereby enabling reuse of hardware elements across multiple missions. Another important difference is the decision to use reusable rockets and interplanetary spacecraft. COTS (commercial off-the-shelf) hardware such as capsules, rockets, engines, spacesuits and inflatable spacecraft modules are preferred in order to further reduce expenses by saving on development costs. ISRU (In Situ Resource Utilisation) technology is used for manufacturing propellant and breathable air, and ideally also water, thereby reducing launch mass and mission cost. This strategy of controlling program cost will make it possible to send humans to Mars sooner, and will enable more missions to be conducted and more countries to be involved, thus benefiting more people.</p>

<p>The mission achieves improved safety by using capsules to ferry crews between the surfaces and orbits of both Earth and Mars; pre-deploying virtually all the base hardware, including the MAV (Mars Ascent Vehicle), Surface Habitat, surface vehicles, power and ISRU systems; and providing redundant backup systems to the base (i.e. spare hab, rovers, solar panels, etc.)</p>

<p>IMRS and the Blue Dragon architecture are designed as a first step in a broader process of settlement rather than a standalone Apollo-style &ldquo;flags and footprints&rdquo; program of purely science and/or exploration. This affects the destination of the mission, as well as surface activities. The reasoning is that science and exploration can proceed more easily and rapidly once a permanent human presence has been established. Research activities during the surface stay will be oriented around science, exploration and engineering, primarily in the context of habitation and settlement of Mars.</p>

<p>It is hoped you will enjoy learning more about this exciting project, which has the potential to bring the world together in a peaceful and historic adventure, namely, opening up a new world for human civilisation. The purpose of this website is to present and share this plan in order to engage the interest of space-faring nations and space companies and researchers.</p>
