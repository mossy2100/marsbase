<h3>Nomenclature</h3>

<p>Some words about words are necessary.</p>

<ol>
	<li>The word &ldquo;Earthian&rdquo; is used as the proper noun referring to things of Earth. Although perhaps not as common in mainstream literature, particularly science fiction, as &ldquo;Terran&rdquo;, it is often preferred in academic writing. (The term was also oft-used by one of the 20<sup>th</sup> century&rsquo;s greatest geniuses, R. Buckminster Fuller.) It is also a more suitable word than &ldquo;terrestrial&rdquo;. Although &ldquo;extraterrestrial&rdquo; means &ldquo;not from Earth&rdquo;, &ldquo;terrestrial&rdquo; is more usually an antonym of &ldquo;aquatic&rdquo;, i.e. meaning &ldquo;of the land&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;from Earth&rdquo;.</li>
	<li>The equivalent proper noun for Mars is &ldquo;Martian&rdquo;.</li>
	<li>The words &ldquo;Earthian&rdquo; and &ldquo;Martian&rdquo; are always capitalised (e.g. &ldquo;she is a Martian&rdquo;, &ldquo;the Martian sky&rdquo;), being proper nouns analogous to &ldquo;Australian&rdquo;, &ldquo;Italian&rdquo;, etc.</li>
	<li>The words &ldquo;Earth&rdquo;, &ldquo;Moon&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sun&rdquo; are also proper nouns and therefore always capitalised.</li>
	<li>In accordance with modern usage, the word &ldquo;Earth&rdquo; is not preceded by the definite article &ldquo;the&rdquo;, unlike &ldquo;the Moon&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Sun&rdquo;.</li>
	<li>When talking about Mars, the prefix &ldquo;areo&rdquo;, meaning &ldquo;Mars&rdquo;, replaces &ldquo;geo&rdquo;, meaning &ldquo;Earth&rdquo;, in words that normally begin with that prefix. Thus, &ldquo;<i>geo</i>thermal&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;<i>areo</i>thermal&rdquo;, &ldquo;<i>geo</i>logy&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;<i>areo</i>logy&rdquo;, &ldquo;<i>geo</i>stationary&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;<i>areo</i>stationary&rdquo;, and so forth.</li>
	<li>The unusual words &ldquo;periareon&rdquo; and &ldquo;apoareon&rdquo; refer to the low and high points, respectively, in an orbit around Mars. They are Martian equivalents of the words &ldquo;perigee&rdquo; and &ldquo;apogee&rdquo;, which refer to orbits around Earth, and &ldquo;perihelion&rdquo; and &ldquo;aphelion&rdquo;, which refer to orbits around the Sun.</li>
	<li>The word &ldquo;methalox&rdquo; refers to bipropellant comprised of liquid oxygen and liquid methane. There&rsquo;s no standard term for this, and variants include LO2/LNG, LOX/LCH4, LOx/Methane, and every possible combination and permutation. Using the word makes the text more readable and reduces acronym density.</li>
	<li>As discussed in <a href="/section5#section5-4">Timekeeping</a>, the word &ldquo;sol&rdquo; appears frequently where you might normally expect to read &ldquo;day&rdquo;, because the crew will be operating on Mars time. However, the words &ldquo;day&rdquo; and &ldquo;night&rdquo; are still used for the light and dark parts of the sol, respectively. No special word is used for a Martian week, which is a period of 7 sols.</li>
	<li>For conciseness, the initialism &ldquo;EVA&rdquo;, which stands for &ldquo;Extra Vehicular Activity&rdquo;, refers to any activity outside a vehicle or habitat during which the astronaut is wearing a spacesuit. Although the initialism &ldquo;EHA&rdquo; for &ldquo;Extra Habitat Activity&rdquo; is sometimes used, &ldquo;EVA&rdquo; is much more common and often refers to working outside a habitat, even if it&rsquo;s technically not a vehicle.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Acronyms and initialisms</h3>

<p>There&rsquo;s a large number of acronyms and initialisms in this book, drawn primarily from usage in space, science and engineering, plus a few from IT and military, and some have been newly invented for the purpose of this document. Unfortunately this is the nature of the topic, and acronyms are a preferable shorthand to the expanded version in most cases. Each is expanded on first use, and can also be looked up in the <a href="/abbrev">Abbreviations</a> section towards the end of the book. Abbreviations for chemical formulae are also provided in the same section.</p>

<h3>Updates</h3>

<p>In response to feedback and corrections received after the book goes live, or if I feel inspired to add new material, I may make updates and re-upload the book. In addition, if the right people like the idea, there could be progress with regard to actual implementation of the IMRS plan.</p>
