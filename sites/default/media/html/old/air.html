<p>Breathable air is required in the Transit and Surface Habs, the Rover, the DragonRider capsules, and in marssuits. As per NASA policy the crew will always be wearing their marssuits inside the DragonRider capsules, although they should only need to breathe from the suits during descent to, and ascent from, Mars.</p>

<ol>
	<li><b>Transit Hab:</b> Although the finer details of the BA 330 are currently unavailable, it will most likely be inflated and pressurised with breathable air from canisters of compressed O2 and N2. Its built-in ECLSS will maintain the air quality during the outbound and return missions, in much the same way as the ISS: scrubbing excess water vapour, CO2 and other contaminants from the habitat atmosphere, and topping up with O2 and N2 as required.</li>
	<li><b>Surface Hab:</b> The Surface Hab (also a BA 330) will have an operating atmosphere of only about half an atmosphere, and will include a compact and lightweight ISAP system (described below) to manufacture breathable air from the local Martian environment. This is necessary to maintain the desired operating pressure within the Surface Hab, replacing losses due to airlock cycling, leaks and other causes. It will also serve to refresh the Rover&rsquo;s atmosphere, and for refilling oxygen tanks for marssuits.</li>
	<li><b>Marssuits:</b> Marssuits will provide astronauts with pure O2 to breathe, and will scrub exhaled CO2 with something like lithium hydroxide canisters. The suits&rsquo; O2 tanks will be refillable from the Surface Hab&rsquo;s ISAP system.</li>
	<li><b>Rover:</b> The pressurised Rover&rsquo;s atmosphere will match the Surface Hab&rsquo;s. It will include a compact, lightweight ECLSS to support extended excursions; however, it will also be possible to top up or freshen its air supply by connecting with the Surface Hab&rsquo;s ISAP system.</li>
	<li><b><i>Pern-1:</i></b> This DragonRider carries the crew from Earth surface to orbit, then docks with <i>Adeona</i>. Therefore it will initially contain normal Terran air, which will merge with the spacecraft atmosphere after docking. On arrival at Mars, <i>Pern-1</i> carries the crew, wearing marssuits, from Mars orbit to the surface. It will initially contain air from <i>Adeona</i>. When they arrive at Mars surface and pop the hatch, that air will escape and <i>Pern-1</i> will fill with Martian atmosphere. However, the crew will be breathing pure O2 from their suits.</li>
	<li><b><i>Pern-2:</i></b> This DragonRider, which initially sits atop the MAV, carries the crew from Mars surface to orbit at the end of the surface mission. After the crew has entered it will contain Martian atmosphere, but the crew will be wearing their marssuits and breathing pure O2. Upon docking with <i>Adeona</i>, the capsule&#39;s atmosphere will be evacuated and refilled with air from inside <i>Adeona</i> before the crew transfer into the Transit Hab.</li>
	<li><b><i>Pern-3:</i></b> This DragonRider is launched from Earth and will therefore contain normal Terran atmosphere. When it docks with <i>Adeona</i>, the air in it will mix with the spacecraft atmosphere, which will be virtually the same. The crew can then enter the capsule and descend to Earth surface.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><b>Transit Hab Atmosphere</b></h2>

<p>The atmosphere inside the Transit Hab will be very similar to normal Terran conditions, with one atmosphere (101.3kPa) pressure comprised of approximately 21% O2 and 79% N2, plus small amounts of CO2 and H2O. This matches the ISS, the Shuttle, Vostok, Mir and other space stations and spacecraft.</p>

<p>There are many reasons why an Earth-like atmosphere is preferred for use in space:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<p>Discounting hyopgravity effects, the behaviour of the atmosphere is predictable in terms of its interactions with organisms and equipment.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>It reduces the cost of equipment inside the spacecraft. Rather than having to design equipment for a specialised atmosphere, as was necessary with Apollo, Skylab and many other early spacecraft, with an Earth-normal atmosphere many ordinary COTS items developed for Earth can be used in the spacecraft without alteration.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>No adaptation is required for astronauts when moving between the spacecraft and Earth. Physiological effects of long-term exposure to a reduced pressure or low-oxygen atmosphere are not a consideration.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>No time or energy is required to pressurise or depressurise capsules for crew transport to or from Earth.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>A high percentage of buffer gas greatly reduces fire risk.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Although most details about the BA 330 are currently unavailable, it&rsquo;s highly likely that it will be designed for an Earth-normal atmosphere, since one of its proposed applications is space tourism.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><b>Surface Hab Atmosphere and Marssuits</b></h2>

<p>The advantages of a normal Terran atmosphere apply equally well to the Surface Hab as they do to the Transit Hab. However, there are a couple of reasons in favour of a reduced atmospheric pressure for the Surface Hab.</p>

<p>One of these is the potential for reduction in the Surface Hab mass. The higher the internal atmospheric pressure of the Surface Hab, the stronger, and therefore heavier, it needs to be. Our goal should be to minimise the mass of the Surface Hab, due to the significant challenge of landing such a heavy object on Mars.</p>

<p>However, this would only be a compelling reason for a non-standard atmosphere if we were designing a custom piece of hardware for the Surface Hab. Because the plan is to use a BA 330 module, which are designed for standard atmosphere, the habitat mass will be the same regardless of internal air pressure.</p>

<p>A far more compelling reason for a reduced pressure is the potential for a zero prebreathe (ZPB) protocol for EHA&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Spacesuits typically use pure O2 as breathing gas, which simplifies the PLSS (Personal Life Support System) and reduces the suit mass. Minimising suit mass is crucial if astronauts are to healthfully conduct many extended EHA&rsquo;s, as they will wish to do so on Mars. The mass of the Apollo A7L Spacesuits was 91kg, which had an apparent weight on the Moon equivalent to about 15kg. On Mars, a spacesuit of this mass would feel like 34kg, which is far too heavy to work in. Reducing spacesuit mass for Mars, ideally to about 40kg (which will feel like 15kg on Mars) is therefore imperative. For this reason, early marssuits will also only provide O2.</p>

<p>Spacesuit pressures have historically ranged from 26kPa to 57kPa. Spacesuits with higher pressure are sometimes referred to as &ldquo;Zero Prebreathe Spacesuits&rdquo; (ZPS), as they permit an astronaut to transition to the suit without needing to spend any time prebreathing. Prebreathing involves breathing pure oxygen for a period of time, from 30 minutes to several hours, at atmospheric or mid-level pressures in order to purge N2 from the blood and other tissues. This is necessary with low-pressure suits to prevent DCS (decompression sickness, also known as &ldquo;the bends&rdquo;).</p>

<p>ZPS&#39;s for Mars are highly desirable, as they would result in considerable saved time and much greater convenience for the crew, who will wish to conduct EVA/EHA most sols. It&rsquo;s far easier to achieve a ZPB protocol with MCP suits, as these can support a higher pressure while maintaining good mobility. Gas pressurised suits, on the other hand, typically require as low as possible air pressure in order to facilitate effective mobility.</p>

<p>The amount of prebreathing required is based on the decompression ratio (also known as the &ldquo;R value&rdquo;), which is the ratio between the partial pressure of buffer gases in the spacecraft or habitat atmosphere, and the total pressure in the spacesuit:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>R = P<sub>BG</sub> / P<sub>S</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>where:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>P<sub>BG</sub> is the buffer gas partial pressure</p>

	<p>P<sub>S</sub> is the total suit pressure</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our crew will be spending approximately 540 days on the surface of Mars, with an estimated 3-4 (or more) EHA&rsquo;s per week; perhaps around 200-300 total <i>each</i>. Due to the large number of EHA/EVA&rsquo;s required by Mars astronauts, a ZPB protocol is only practical for an R value of 1, because risk of DCS is cumulative. From JSC-25003 &ldquo;Internal Atmospheric Pressure and Composition for Planet Surface Habitats and Extravehicular Mobility Units&rdquo; by P. D. Campbell, 1991 (highlight added):</p>

<blockquote>
	<p><i>An R value of more than 1.0 may have a risk of decompression sickness. This risk increases with increased R value. The risk of decompression sickness during a mission is <span class="highlight">statistically cumulative over a number of decompressions during that mission</span>; therefore, the mission duration and frequency of EVA must be considered when determining an appropriate value for R for a given mission. A statistical analysis of cumulative risk shows that for R=1.22, the risk of decompression sickness after ten decompressions is 7 percent, while for R=1.4 the risk is 37 percent. Therefore, <span class="highlight">cumulative risk is an important criterion for long-term planet surface missions and it increases rapidly as R is increased above 1.0</span>. If the decompressions are not separated by enough time to eliminate previously formed gas bubble nuclei from body tissues, the risk of decompression sickness on subsequent decompressions is also greatly increased.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fortunately, it is possible to design an atmosphere for the Surface Hab that will permit an R value of 1.0, in order to support a ZPB protocol, benefiting the astronauts&rsquo; health and saving a lot of time. This is very strong reason in favour of a non-standard atmosphere in the Surface Hab.</p>

<p>Atmospheres in early spacecraft had low total pressure, low oxygen pressure, or both. However, research conducted since then has more clearly defined the limits for extended exposure to artificial atmospheres.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><b>Oxygen pressure</b></h3>

<p>The minimum partial pressure of oxygen required to support human physiology is 16kPa. Although some researchers recommend a minimum partial pressure of oxygen of 18kPa for long-duration space missions, 16kPa is perfectly safe.</p>

<p>16kPa O2 is equivalent to an altitude of about 2400m. Most people can ascend to this altitude without difficulty, however, altitude sickness may occur above this level. Astronauts can easily be conditioned for an O2 pressure of 16kPa by training in a hypobaric chamber, or at this altitude. Note that the partial pressure of oxygen in airline cabins ranges from 16kPa to 18kPa, and more than 140 million people live permanently at an altitude of 2400m or greater.</p>

<p>Acclimatisation to reduced O2 pressure at altitude is characterised by an increase in pulse and breathing rate. It is a consideration that there is already increased strain on the heart in a microgravity environment, and it would be preferable not to cause any additional strain. However, the Surface Hab will be in a gravity environment on the surface of Mars, and, although this is still a reduced gravity environment, the effects on the cardiovascular system will not be as severe as in microgravity.</p>

<p>As discussed, selecting this O2 level will enable a ZPB protocol without risk of DCS, as well as a safe habitat atmosphere, whereas a higher O2 pressure would involve compromising one or the other.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><b>Total pressure</b></h3>

<p>A pure oxygen atmosphere introduces an unacceptably high risk of fire, such as that which occurred in the Apollo 1 Command Module. The upper limit of oxygen concentration with regard to fire safety has not been clearly defined, but 30% is considered reasonable. This gives us a total atmospheric pressure of 53.33kPa.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><b>Carbon dioxide pressure</b></h3>

<p>Nominal atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and H2O must also be determined. According to SMAC (&ldquo;Spacecraft Maximum Allowable Concentrations&rdquo;), the maximum CO2 concentration is 0.7%. A CO2 concentration of 1% can cause drowsiness, with more serious symptoms occurring at higher concentrations. A typical concentration in normal spacecraft operations is 0.5%, which is a reasonable design goal. This gives us a target CO2 partial pressure of around 0.27kPa.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><b>Water vapour pressure</b></h3>

<p>With regard to water vapour, NASA specifies a RH (Relative Humidity) of 30-70%, i.e. an average of about 50%. Our target operating temperature is 295K (about 72&deg;F or 22&deg;C), which is considered optimal for human comfort and productivity. The saturated water vapour pressure at this temperature, and a pressure of 53.33kPa, is 2.62kPa. Our target average water vapour partial pressure will be 50% of this, or 1.31kPa.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><b>Buffer gas pressure</b></h3>

<p>Although the Surface Hab&rsquo;s atmosphere will contain trace amounts of other gases, the required buffer gas pressure can be calculated by subtracting the partial pressures of O2, CO2 and H2O from the total pressure:</p>

<table class="equation-table">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>P<sub>BG</sub></td>
			<td>= P<sub>TOTAL</sub> - P<sub>O2</sub> - P<sub>CO2</sub> - P<sub>H2O</sub></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td>= 53.33kPa - 16.00kPa - 0.27kPa - 1.31kPa</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td>= 35.75kPa</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>Note that the buffer gas in the Surface Hab will not be pure N2, as in the Transit Hab and ISS. The ISAP system extracts N2 and Ar together from the Martian atmosphere, for use as buffer gas. This is explained in greater detail in the section below about the ISAP system. Because the Martian atmosphere is 1.9% N2 and 2.1% Ar, this gives:</p>

<table class="equation-table">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>P<sub>N2</sub></td>
			<td>= (1.9 / (1.9 + 2.1)) * 35.75kPa</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td>= 16.98kPa</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>P<sub>Ar</sub></td>
			<td>= (2.1 / (1.9 + 2.1)) * 35.75kPa</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td>= 18.77kPa</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<h2><b>Marssuits</b></h2>

<p>The most advanced MCP suit currently in development is the BioSuit being developed at MIT, which currently supports a pressure of almost 30kPa. However, MCP suits should be able to support an operating pressure of 35.75kPa before a human mission to Mars.</p>

<p>From private communications with Dava Newman, Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics and Engineering Systems at MIT and a leading MCP suit researcher:</p>

<blockquote><i>We&rsquo;ve made some outstanding progress this semester on our active materials and believe we can now achieve the 30 kPa pressure level. It shouldn&rsquo;t be asking too much for us to achieve the mid-30 kPa, especially by 2030!</i></blockquote>

<p>According to Prof. Newman, it&rsquo;s unlikely that suit pressure much higher than 35kPa will be sought as this would begin to compromise mobility, which is the primary goal of this suit design. For a ZPB protocol without risk of DCS, the suit pressure must equal the buffer gas pressure in the Surface Hab (i.e. R = 1.0). It is for this reason that the O2 partial pressure in the Hab must be constrained to about 16kPa. It cannot be much lower as this would be unhealthy, yet it cannot be much higher because, for fire safety, the O2 concentration should not exceed 30%.</p>

<p>A buffer gas pressure of 35kPa is considerably lower than the buffer gas pressure in Terran atmosphere, which is 80kPa. If MCP marssuit pressures can be increased to 40kPa in the future, this will permit 17kPa O2 pressure in the Surface Hab, which will be an improvement. The ultimate engineering goal will be a MCP marssuit that provides excellent mobility <i>and</i> an Earth-like atmosphere.</p>

<p>More information is provided in the section about <a href="/marssuits-and-airlocks">Marssuits and Airlocks</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><b>Oxygen toxicity</b></h3>

<p>This suit pressure is within safe limits for O2 toxicity. As reported in report JSC-25003 &ldquo;Internal Atmospheric Pressure and Composition for Planet Surface Habitats and Extravehicular Mobility Units&rdquo; by P. D. Campbell, O2 toxicity can occur when exposed to a high partial pressure for an extended period, i.e. above 40.5kPa for more than approximately 24 hours. The same report also states:</p>

<blockquote><i>For EVA&rsquo;s of six to eight hours, 100 percent oxygen can be used at pressures up to 41.4 kPa (6.0 psia) with absolutely no risk.</i></blockquote>

<p>As the proposed suit pressure of approximately 35kPa falls below this threshold, oxygen toxicity is not a risk with this design.</p>

<p>It is because of the risk of O2 toxicity that marssuits with O2 pressure much higher than 40kPa may not be desirable. Although it&rsquo;s unlikely that anyone would spend more than 24 hours in a marssuit, this is just an approximate threshold and different people will have different levels of susceptibility.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><b>The Rover</b></h2>

<p>Aspects of atmosphere design relevant for the Surface Hab apply equally to the Rover. The goal is to provide a safe and healthy atmosphere and support a ZPB protocol, while keeping the mass of the Rover as low as practical.</p>

<p>There are several advantages if the Rover atmosphere has the same composition and pressure as the Surface Hab:</p>

<ul>
	<li>No adaptation or prebreathing will be required when transitioning between the Surface Hab and the Rover.</li>
	<li>The same equipment (such as laptops, scientific instruments and sensors) can be used in both environments, which is more convenient and reduces cost and complexity of design and testing.</li>
	<li>The same ZPB protocol can be used for both the Surface Hab and the Rover without risk of DCS.</li>
</ul>

<p>With the Surface Hab and Rover having the same atmospheres it may also be possible to connect the Rover directly to the Surface Hab: perhaps with a person-sized hatch to make it easy to transfer between them without needing to suit up or go through the airlock, or perhaps simply with a pipe to freshen the Rover&rsquo;s air.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><b>DragonRiders</b></h2>

<p>In <em>Pern-1</em> and <em>Pern-3</em>, the internal atmosphere will be either Earth-normal, or the same as in <i>Adeona</i>, which is virtually Earth-normal. <em>Pern-2</em> will contain Martian atmosphere, but the crew will be breathing pure O2 from their marssuits.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><b>Maintenance of atmosphere pressures</b></h2>

<p>The atmospheric pressure in the Transit and Surface Habs and Rover will reduce over time due to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Purging of waste gases (e.g. CO2).</li>
	<li>Leaks. Although designed for zero leaks, in practice some small leaks are possible.</li>
	<li>Experiments.</li>
	<li>Airlock cycling, for the Surface Hab and Rover.</li>
	<li>Refilling of marssuit and Rover tanks from the Surface Hab&rsquo;s supply.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pressure loss is managed in the same way as on the ISS. Oxygen and buffer gas are kept in separate tanks so that both the partial pressure of oxygen and the total atmospheric pressure can be precisely controlled.</p>

<ol>
	<li>If the partial pressure of O2 falls below a given threshold, then O2 is replenished from tanks.</li>
	<li>If the total pressure falls below a given threshold, buffer gas is added.</li>
</ol>

<p>The ECLSS controls concentrations of CO2, H2O and contaminants such as CH4, NH3 and others.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><b>ISAP (In Situ Air Production)</b></h2>

<p>The primary constituents of the Martian atmosphere are CO2, N2, Ar, whereas Earth&rsquo;s are mainly N2, O2 and Ar. Therefore, all the elements required to make breathable, Earth-like air are readily available from Martian air. The Surface Hab will therefore include a ISAP unit, which relaxes constraints on air supply. It will then be unnecessary for the Surface Hab to bring O2 and buffer gas from Earth, although tanks for storing these will still be required.</p>

<p>The ISAP unit may initially be used to inflate the Surface Hab to the required operating pressure. The Surface Hab is comprised of an inflatable module. It probably won&rsquo;t be landed in a deflated state, having been fitted out on Earth; however, it may be landed with a reduced internal pressure. After landing, the Surface Hab&rsquo;s systems will be remotely activated from Earth, initiating the ISAP unit and causing the internal air pressure to begin increasing to the desired level. As the Surface Hab is being sent one launch window earlier than the crew, there will be about 20 months to achieve this, and to test the Surface Hab&rsquo;s other systems, before the crew leave Earth.</p>

<p>The DRA proposes partial ISAP in which N2 is extracted from the Martian atmosphere for use as a buffer gas. However, it is probably energetically cheaper to simply use the gas that remains after dust, CO2, H2O and toxins are removed from Martian air, as this is mostly N2 and Ar. Argon is a perfectly useful buffer gas. It represents about 1% of air on Earth (i.e. we breathe it all the time), and is non-toxic and unreactive. There&rsquo;s no practical reason to separate it from N2, which would require more energy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4><b>The ISAP process:</b></h4>

<blockquote>
	<p><b>Step 1:</b> Mars atmosphere is drawn into the system through a dust filter.</p>

	<p><b>Step 2:</b> Water is removed from the gas mix via adsorption by zeolite 3A. The captured water is stored in the Surface Hab&rsquo;s water tank and used to replace recycling losses, and as a source of hydrogen and oxygen, which are obtained using electrolysis.</p>

	<p><b>Step 3:</b> A carbon dioxide freezer is used to separate CO2 (about 96%) from the remainder of the gas mix.</p>

	<p><b>Step 4:</b> The CO2 is reacted with H2 via the RWGS reaction:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>CO2 + H2 &rarr; CO + H2O</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>The H2O produced is returned to the water tank, and the CO is stored for use in fuel cells.</p>

	<p>The gas mix that remains after CO2 is removed is mostly N2 and Ar, with some undesirables such as O3, CO, and NO*. It may also contain harmless trace amounts of various noble gases such as neon, xenon and krypton, which are inert and non-toxic.</p>

	<p><b>Step 5:</b> The gas mixture is passed through an ozone scrubber, which reduces the O3 to O2.</p>

	<p><b>Step 6:</b> The resultant gas mixture is then passed through an ordinary automobile 3-way catalytic converter, which converts CO and NO into CO2 and N2.</p>

	<p><b>Step 7:</b> The result is a safe buffer gas comprised mostly of N2 and Ar, with small amounts of O2 and CO2, and traces of inert noble gases. This mixture can be combined with additional O2 to provide breathing gas for the Surface Hab. The CO2 level in this gas mixture is slightly higher than the proposed upper limit for the habitat atmosphere, but this excess will be removed by the ECLSS.</p>

<p>More research needs to be done into this system. It is necessary to determine the rate at which breathing gas can be manufactured, how much the ISAP unit will weigh, its volume and power requirements, and how it will integrate with the ECLSS.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><small>* NO is technically non-toxic, but rapidly oxidises to toxic NO2 when mixed with O2.</small></p>
