<p>The Bigelow Aerospace BA 330 module is an inflatable space habitat projected to become available from about 2016-17. The BA 330’s are designed for use in space stations, interplanetary vehicles, or surface habitats on the Moon or Mars, and include ECLSS designed to safely support a crew of six long term, contained within a solid core.</p>

<p>The BA 330 modules may be launched in a deflated state, thus permitting them to be launched within a smaller diameter payload fairing, reducing launch costs. They may be connected together to form larger structures; for example, here is Bigelow Aerospace’s concept for their “Alpha Station”, which shows four connected BA 330 modules, with three SpaceX Dragon capsule attached:</p>

<p>The skin of a BA 330 is comprised of 24 - 36 layers for ballistic, thermal and radiation protection. The BA 330’s radiation protection is equal to the ISS, however, its ballistic protection is superior.</p>

<h2>Docking</h2>

<p>The current plan is that the BA 330 modules will use the NASA Docking System (NDS), which has been developed for the Orion Crew Vehicle and Commercial Crew Vehicles. SpaceX&#39;s DragonRider capsules will also use the NDS, therefore, the DragonRider capsules will also be able to dock with BA 330 modules.</p>

<p>Bigelow and SpaceX have already made an agreement to cooperate on the BA 330.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Internal Volume</h2>

<p>The BA 330 modules have&nbsp;an internal volume of 330 cubic metres, which is ample for a crew of six, including storage for consumables. The bare minimum free volume per person required for space travel is currently considered to be 10m<sup>3</sup>, although the optimal is considered to be about 19m<sup>3</sup>.</p>

<p>The BA 330 is spacious compared with previous crewed spacecraft and space stations. They are also significantly less dense. A BA 330 weighs about 20 tonnes, yet has approximately three times the internal volume of the ISS Destiny module, which weighs about 15 tonnes.</p>

<h2>Versions</h2>

<p>There are 3 versions of the BA 330 planned:</p>

<ol>
  <li>BA 330 for Earth orbit</li>
  <li>BA 330-DS (Deep Space) for interplanetary space</li>
  <li>BA 330-MDS (Modified Deep Space) for the surface of the Moon or Mars</li>
</ol>

<h2>Launching the BA 330</h2>

<p>The mass of a BA 330 is approximately 20-23 tonnes, and it has an estimated deflated diameter of about 3.5m and a length of 14m. The rocket currently under consideration by Bigelow Aerospace for launching these to orbit is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V" target="_blank">Atlas V</a>. The fairing of the current version of the SpaceX Falcon Heavy is not long enough.</p>

<p>The Atlas V Heavy has a payload diameter of either 5.4m, a payload length of 16m, and can carry 29.4 tonnes to LEO, which would certainly do the job. However, the Atlas V is a flexible vehicle with a range of payload configurations, including diameters of 4m or 5.4m, and lengths ranging from 9m to 16m or even more. An alternative configuration may be developed specifically for the BA 330, for example, an Atlas V 452, which would have a 4m diameter fairing and be capable of carrying approximately 21 tonnes to LEO.</p>
