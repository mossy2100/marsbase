<p>“Blue Dragon” is a new humans-to-Mars mission architecture that exploits some of the latest developments in space technology, such as reusable rockets, capsules that can land on solid ground, inflatable space habitats, and mechanical counter-pressure spacesuits. It is modern, safe, practical and affordable. It could be used for missions to disparate locations on Mars, or it could be used to greater benefit by running multiple missions to a single location, as this website describes.</p>

<p>The child pages listed below describe the architecture, mostly in relation to high-level design choices without going into deep engineering detail, which is yet to be done. If you would like to contribute your skills to developing some of the finer engineering details of the architecture, or to help with improving estimates of program cost, please let me know via the <a href="/contact">contact form</a> or the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/marssettlement" target="_blank">MSRO Facebook page</a>.</p>

<p>Blue Dragon is a proposed evolution of the NASA Human Exploration of Mars - Design Reference Architecture (DRA) 5.0 [DRAKE2]. Refinements to the DRA described at this website are intended to improve safety, reduce cost, and to achieve a much better overall result. The DRA is likely to be the most mature Mars mission architecture currently available, having been iteratively developed by hundreds of qualified people since 1995. Nonetheless, like anything, it has the potential to be further improved on the basis of new science, technology and ideas.</p>

<p>The Blue Dragon architecture does not have precisely the same goals as the DRA, although they are very similar.</p>

<p>The DRA proposes a series of three more-or-less identical missions to Mars, each to different, scientifically interesting locations, and at these locations to perform exploration of, and scientific research about, Mars; for example, analysing rocks, dust, subsurface ice and the Martian atmosphere, searching for past or extant life, etc.</p>

<p>The DRA is therefore, effectively, “Apollo on Mars”. Each mission in the Apollo program went to a different location on the Moon. Although the scientific research performed at the Apollo sites has been useful for investigation into future settlement of the Moon, none of the Apollo sites were considered as locations of future settlements, because settlement was not the objective. The world was amazed with the achievements of Apollo, and it was hoped that Apollo would continue on through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Applications_Program" target="_blank">Apollo Applications Program</a> and that a permanent human presence would be established on the Moon. However, this never eventuated, and at that time the private sector was not in a position to undertake such a challenge itself.</p>

<p>During the past 40 years since Apollo there has been considerable ongoing interest in establishing a lunar settlement, with the <a href="http://www.asi.org/" target="_blank">Artemis Society</a> and their associated public outreach group the <a href="http://www2.moonsociety.org/" target="_blank">Moon Society</a> being major proponents. However, as robotic exploration of Mars has progressed and our understanding of the red planet has developed, a much stronger desire has emerged in the global community for settlement of Mars. This is apparent in recently proposed private missions such as <a href="http://www.inspirationmars.org/" target="_blank">Inspiration Mars</a> and <a href="http://www.mars-one.com/" target="_blank">Mars One</a>, and in the stated plans of companies like <a href="http://www.spacex.com/" target="_blank">SpaceX</a> (Space Exploration Technologies) and <a href="http://www.virgingalactic.com/" target="_blank">Virgin Galactic</a>.</p>

<p>It has become clear that the number of people interested in settlement of Mars far outweighs those interested in settlement of the Moon, or Earth orbit. Because of Mars’ similarities with Earth, such as a day length of an approximately 24 hours, seasons, weather, a transparent atmosphere, a coloured sky and familiar-looking terrain highly reminiscent of Terran deserts, settlement of Mars is far more amenable to the human imagination and consequently has greater appeal. In addition, its relative abundance of all the elements necessary for life and technological civilisation, including a variety of options for energy production (solar, wind, areothermal and nuclear), make it a more attractive and affordable settlement target than any alternatives.</p>

<p>As our technical capability develops, interest in human settlement of Mars grows steadily. The facts that over 200,000 people have applied for a one-way trip to Mars as part of the Mars One initiative, plus the consistent turnout to international Mars conferences, are strong indicators of this trend.</p>

<p>Inspiration Mars and Mars One represent the first two of what is likely to be a series of private enterprise missions to Mars. These missions have developed from a growing interest in settlement of Mars, and have stimulated yet more interest. More public, private or public-private combined missions are likely to follow, especially as new possibilities are enabled by the development of new COTS space hardware.</p>
