<p>There are fundamentally two options for a H2M mission:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Opposition-class or “short stay” mission.</li>
	<li>Conjunction-class or “long stay” mission.</li>
</ol>

<p>Blue Dragon is a long stay mission, using the same rationale as the DRA and most other architectures. While the long stay option means a longer and more expensive mission, it greatly increases the amount of time spent on Mars in proportion to the period spent in space. A more detailed explanation follows below.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Opposition-class or “short stay” mission</h2>

<p>A short stay mission involves a trip out to Mars (around 5-7 months), then spend, say, 14-30 days on the surface doing science and exploration, then launch and come home. However, after a few weeks Mars and Earth will have moved to new positions in their orbits, and will no longer be optimally aligned. Since we are constrained by fuel requirements, the return trip must necessarily be longer; in fact, more than one year.</p>

<p>Although actual numbers will vary depending on the timing of the launch, propulsion technology and available fuel, the figures below are indicatative of the schedule for a 30-day short stay mission:</p>

<h2>Conjunction-class or “long stay” mission</h2>

<p>A long stay mission begins by flying out to Mars when it’s at closest approach, with a trip duration of approximately 5-7 months. The crew then remain on the surface while the two planets orbit the Sun along their respective paths until they’re again coming up to closest approach approximately 1.5 years later. The crew then launch and return to Earth, again on a minimum duration trajectory of approximately 5-7 months. As before, although the actual schedule will be determined by the timing of the mission and the vehicles used, the figures shown in the table below are indicative of a long stay mission schedule.</p>

<table class="mission-days">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Outbound flight</td>
			<td>210 d</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Surface mission</td>
			<td>496 d</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Return flight</td>
			<td>210 d</td>
		</tr>
		<tr class="total">
			<td>Total</td>
			<td>916 d</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Total time in space</td>
			<td>420 d</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>% time on Mars</td>
			<td>54%</td>

<h2>Comparison and discussion</h2>

<p>A short stay mission seems sensible and conservative for an initial human mission, and is indeed safer in some ways. It greatly reduces the length of time that the surface habitat, surface vehicles, marssuits and other surface systems will be required, which reduces the potential for any of these systems to fail during the surface mission. Of course, we want to ensure that the astronauts are safe, and for the first human mission, or the first few, this approach seems appropriate.</p>

<p>However, with a short stay architecture the crew spends almost all that time in space and only a very small fraction (about 5%) of the overall mission duration on Mars. Apart from the fact that going to Mars is the whole point of the mission, the space environment is less healthy than the Martian environment in terms of exposure to microgravity and radiation. It’s safer to be on Mars than in space. So any safety benefits gained by a short stay mission and reducing the length of the stay on Mars are entirely offset by the increased time spent in space, and at the cost of the the original purpose of the mission: to explore Mars.</p>

<p>Although the long stay option increases mission duration by 266 days or about 40%, the amount of time spent on Mars increases by a factor of almost 14 (over a year longer), and accounts for more than half the mission duration. The amount of time spent in space is reduced by one third. Most mission planners agree that a long stay mission profile is smarter and better, as it delivers a much greater ROI, which is why Mars Direct, Mars-Oz, DRA and other architectures are all based on conjunction-class missions. It may seem that a 2.5 year mission is a big risk and a big challenge; but then, so is a 1.8 year mission. If a short stay mission is achievable then so is a long stay one, and the pay-off is well worth it.</p>
