<p>Gold Dragon is simply a MAV test. Launching from the surface of Mars is one of the greatest challenges in a humans-to-Mars architecture, which is why it was omitted from Mars One, and why some people favour one-way architectures.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, considering SpaceX’s Grasshopper RLS technology, Masten Space Systems’ Xombie rocket, Blue Origin’s New Shepard VTOL rocket, and other developments currently underway in the space industry, it seems very likely that a vehicle that can be adapted for Mars ascent will be available in the near term; certainly within the time frame of the Blue Dragon architecture.</p>

<p>The MAV in the Blue Dragon architecture performs EDL at Mars. Then the propellant for the ascent stage is manufactured from local Martian resources. At the end of the surface element, the ascent stage with DragonRider capsule (the ascent capsule) launches from Mars, leaving the descent stage with its ISPP and ISEP hardware behind. On reaching space, the ascent capsule performs MOR with the MTV. All of these operations are more-or-less impossible to properly test on Earth, and it would be risky (perhaps unacceptably so) to attempt to launch humans from the surface of Mars without having tested this launch system at least once.</p>

<p>The Gold Dragon MAV will be flown to Mars, landed somewhere close to the proposed IMRS base, fuelled and launched to Mars orbit. As there will be no MTV in orbit at the time, the only part of MAV lifecycle that would not be tested would be docking of the DragonRider ascent capsule. It could be left on orbit and picked up later, or allowed to fall back to Mars.</p>

<p>The intention is to send a Gold Dragon mission at least once, and perhaps again if results indicate that the vehicle needs to be further improved before it can be declared human-rated. While this is expensive, it is fairly important to know that the ISPP system and MAV will work as desired.</p>
