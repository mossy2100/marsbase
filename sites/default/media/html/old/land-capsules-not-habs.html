<p>In contrast to the DRA, the Hab does not wait in Mars orbit, but, like the MAV, is pre-deployed to Mars surface, activated, and its systems checked out remotely. There are three main reasons for this:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		<p>It’s far safer to land the crew in a proven EDL system such as a 6 tonne capsule, rather than a 30 tonne habitat (or a similar-sized descent/ascent vehicle).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Pre-deployment of the Hab enables testing of its systems, including ISRU and power, providing peace of mind before the crew leave Earth.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>With a base-first strategy the architecture doesn’t require a new Hab for each mission, which saves money.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>One of the innovations in Mars Direct is that the ERV (Earth Return Vehicle) is landed on Mars one launch opportunity (~26 months) prior to arrival of the crew. Once at Mars, the ERV’s power system and propellant plant are activated and the LOX/LCH4 bipropellant is manufactured quickly to minimise hydrogen boil-off. In this way, the crew and mission planners know that there’s a fully fuelled vehicle at the base ready to bring them back, before the crew leave Earth. This idea became incorporated into the DRA, and is also part of Blue Dragon.</p>

<p>It this is a good idea for the MAV then it applies equally well to the Hab, which is equally mission critical. The crew spend minutes in the MAV, but 1.5 years in the Hab. If the Hab is known to be fully operational before the crew leave Earth it will greatly improve the confidence of mission directors and the crew.</p>

<p>In Mars Direct, the crew travel to Mars and land in the habitat. In the DRA, the habitat waits on orbit for arrival of the crew in the Mars Transfer Vehicle, then they transfer to the habitat and land in the habitat. Both architectures have the same two problems:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		<p>The crew would not have the peace of mind of knowing there’s a fully functional habitat ready for them on the surface of Mars.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Landing a 20-40 tonne Hab may involve a new EDL system that has never been properly tested before.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>It will be much safer to land the crew in a SpaceX DragonRider capsule. It’s likely that Dragon and DragonRider capsules will have been used multiple times for carrying crew and/or cargo between Earth orbit and surface, and the Red Dragon landing system may similarly have been used several times to deliver cargo and experiments to Mars.</p>

<p>The Hab will be heavier than anything else ever landed on Mars before, other than the Mars Ascent Vehicle. It will probably not be possible to thoroughly test EDL of the Hab prior to the actual deployment. Naturally we will run computer simulations, but these are never perfect. It’s unlikely we would attempt to test the Hab’s EDL system on Earth because the atmosphere and gravity are completely different. It’s therefore very difficult to be 100% certain that an EDL system developed for landing such a heavy piece of hardware on Mars will work, just as it was very difficult to be sure that the EDL system for Curiosity would work.</p>

<p>Rather than risk LOC (Loss Of Crew), it’s much safer to use a proven EDL system for landing the crew on Mars, for example, the Red Dragon, if this has indeed been utilised for one or more robotic science missions or cargo deliveries. Even if Ice Dragon or other Red Dragon-based missions are not executed, the Red Dragon EDL system can be utilised two or more times within the Blue Dragon architecture to pre-deploy cargo.</p>

<p>A crewed version of the Red Dragon will provide the exact same, proven method for landing on Mars. On arrival at Mars surface in a DragonRider, wearing suits, the crew will transfer to the Rover and drive to the Hab.</p>

<p>In the unlikely event that the Hab crashes on Mars we can improve the design, build another one and send that, and keep doing so until we succeed, without ever risking LOC. We will only send the crew when there’s a MAV, Hab, Rover, power system, supplies, and everything else already in place on Mars to ensure a successful surface mission. This approach may seem to take pre-deployment to an extreme, but it makes sense when&nbsp;running several missions back-to-back at the same location. It allows the architecture to be much cheaper, safer and more repeatable. Everything will be ready for the crew on Mars before they even leave Earth.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Getting to the Hab</h2>

<p>Because the crew land in a DragonRider rather than in a habitat, a method for safely transferring to the Hab is necessary.</p>

<p>The capsule will not be able to land too close to the Hab (or any other part of the base), because dust and debris thrown up by the engines during the landing may cause damage. They may have to land several hundred metres or perhaps a kilometre away. After spending six months in &micro;g, it would be impractical to expect the crew to walk that far, in suits, immediately after landing on Mars, as they would have become weakened by the time spent in space.</p>

<p>Therefore, they’ll be picked up by the Rover. After the dust has settled post-landing, the Rover is remotely driven from the Hab to the DragonRider’s LZ. As a backup, both the crew and MCC (Mission Control Centre) will have the ability to remote-control the Rover.</p>

<p>The path the Rover will take between Hab and the crew’s landing point will have been driven along several times, and will be clear of hazards. The LZ will have been decided during the previous ~20 months by exploring the surrounding terrain with the Rover via remote-control, and finding a smooth, flat, clear and safe path between the Hab and the LZ. As the Rover has a dirt-moving attachment (a front-end loader bucket), it may be used to make the path yet smoother, clearer and safer during the 20 month window, thus making absolutely certain that the crew will reach the Hab safely. This strategy relies on the ability to land the DragonRider accurately.</p>

<p>Note: The Blue Dragon architecture does not incorporate suitports, but rather, MCP (Mechanical Counter-Pressure) marssuits. Although suits with suitports offer advantages with regard to dust migration and contamination prevention, they are large, bulky, and have the mobility issues generally associated with gas pressurised space suits. A DragonRider capsule may not be able to accommodate a crew of six wearing gas-pressurised suits with suitports, and in addition, a Rover with six suitports (which would be necessary with this architecture) may be impractical. Instead, the crew are wearing MCP marssuits during EDL, and will enter and exit the Rover and the Hab through their airlocks.</p>
