<p>The MAV will be an VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) vehicle capable of pinpoint landing on Mars, refuelling from local Martian resources, and carrying up six astronauts to Mars orbit. The MAV design currently described in this section uses local Martian water for propellant production; however, note the possibility remains that we will need to bring hydrogen from Earth instead. In this document the MAV is called <i>Athena</i>.</p>

<h2><b>DragonRider</b></h2>

<p>Because it doesn&rsquo;t need to land or even re-enter the atmosphere, the DragonRider is modified accordingly to reduce its mass. It has no heat shield, landing legs, or SuperDraco engines, including associated tankage and fuel. It will retain its RCS. The trunk may potentially be eliminated, or it may be used for solar panels or storage of samples (i.e. rocks and dirt from Mars).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><b>Ascent stage</b></h2>

<p>The middle section of the MAV is the ascent stage, and contains little more than the necessary methalox (LOX/LCH4) ascent engines and associated propellant tankage. On landing these are empty, and then fuelled from local Martian resources.</p>

<p>After launch, when the ascent-stage-plus-capsule has reached orbit, the ascent stage separates and falls back to Mars, while the capsule uses its RCS for docking with the MTV.</p>

<p>The ascent stage engines are methalox, which enables them to be fuelled from local Martian resources. Several types of engines that burn methalox bipropellant have been developed, although it&rsquo;s likely a new one will need to be custom-designed for the specialised use-case of the MAV.</p>

<p>SpaceX are currently developing a new methalox engine called &ldquo;Raptor&rdquo;, which will power the second and upper stage of the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets, and their 10 metre-diameter Mars Colonial Transport vehicle. At an estimated 7.6 tonnes, this engine will be too large for a MAV. SpaceX have stated that they&rsquo;re not currently planning to develop a smaller methalox engine, but who knows. The Raptor design is likely to be more modern and advanced than existing alternatives, and, like their SuperDraco engine, will probably be 3d printed.</p>

<p>If SpaceX will already be involved in this mission due to providing launch vehicles and capsules, using more hardware from the same company should, in theory, reduce costs, if for no other reasons that a fewer number of engineers need to be paid, since engineers who understand the Dragon and Falcon are also probably the same people who understand the Raptor engine.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><b>Descent stage</b></h2>

<p>The lower section is the <i>descent stage</i>, and includes:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Descent engines and fuel tanks</li>
	<li>A sophisticated GNC system (incorporating LION or similar tech)</li>
	<li>One or more rolls of PV material</li>
	<li>ISPP plant (electrolysis unit and Sabatier reactor)</li>
	<li>A water-mining robot called AWESOM (see the section about Water)</li>
</ol>

<p>It&rsquo;s assumed, for now, that the MAV&rsquo;s descent stage and engines used in the <i>Blue Dragon</i> architecture will be similar to that described in the DRA:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p><i>The descent stage is an all-propulsive, legged lander concept that uses four pump-fed LOX/LCH4&nbsp; engines with the following reference characteristics: an Isp of 369 sec, engine oxidizer-to-fuel (O/F) ratio of 3.5, chamber pressure of 600 pounds per square inch (psi), and a nozzle area ratio of 200.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><b>Differences from Mars Direct and the DRA</b></h2>

<p><i>Blue Dragon</i>&rsquo;s MAV is much lighter vehicle than the ERV described in <i>Mars Direct</i>, as it does not include the mass of:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Six tonnes of hydrogen brought from Earth, and associated tankage</li>
	<li>Nuclear reactor</li>
	<li>Light robotic truck for relocating reactor</li>
	<li>Electrical cable to connect MAV to reactor</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead, it includes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>AWESOM water-mining robot</li>
	<li>One or more rolls of PV blanket</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the AWESOM could potentially be delivered separately, in a Red Dragon cargo capsule, in order to reduce landed mass of the MAV.</p>

<p><i>Athena</i>&rsquo;s propellant requirements are lower than for the ERV, being required only for Mars ascent and not TEI, like the MAV in the DRA. Less propellant means smaller fuel tanks (and therefore lower mass), and less time required for the manufacture of propellant.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also no need for RWGS or dissociation of CO2 to produce additional O2, as ample is obtained from water electrolysis. This simplifies the design of the ISPP unit, which can therefore be made smaller and lighter.</p>

<p>The primary variation from the DRA, if we consider the ISRU variation in which CH4 is brought from Earth and O2 is sourced locally, is that the several tonnes of CH4 (7.2t in our calculations - see the section on <i>Propellant</i>) do not need to be brought from Earth. However, note that this mass saving is offset to some degree by additional ISPP equipment. If the landed payload of the MAV is lighter, the whole descent stage can be made lighter since less descent propellant and fewer or less powerful engines will be required.</p>

<h2><b>Nano structured materials</b></h2>

<p>Launching from the surface of Mars has been cited as one of the biggest challenges when it comes to human missions to Mars. It is for this reason that the <i>Mars One</i> plan proposes sending people to Mars one-way, thus side-stepping this difficulty.</p>

<p>The thing that makes launching from Mars difficult, as from any world, is <i>mass</i>, in conjunction with the current state of rocket vehicle technology. The mass of the vehicle, engines and fuel necessarily to transport a payload of six humans (about 400kg) to Mars orbit is on the order of 50 tonnes. The first challenge, therefore, is to land the vehicle on Mars. The heaviest thing we have landed on Mars so far is the <i>Curiosity</i> rover, which is 900kg. With the next generation of SHLLV&rsquo;s we should be able to land payloads of up to 20-30 tonnes on Mars, but this is still far short of what is needed to return humans even as far as Mars orbit. It&rsquo;s for this reason that the concept of ISPP was developed; so the MAV can be landed unfuelled.</p>

<p>We are currently seeing amazing breakthroughs occurring in materials and manufacturing. For example, the SuperDraco engines in the new Dragon V2 capsule are the first ever 3d printed rocket engines, using laser sintering of a material called Inconil, which is an alloy or iron and nickel.</p>

<p>Another, related and amazing new technological breakthrough currently underway is <i>nanostructured materials</i>. Instead of solid matter, these materials are comprised of tiny trusses. The resulting materials are as strong as (for example) steel, but weigh significantly less; potentially orders of magnitude less.</p>
