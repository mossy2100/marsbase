<h2>Marssuits</h2>

<h3>Suitports</h3>

<p>Neither the Surface Hab nor Rover will have suitports. Because the entire crew are landing in a Dragon capsule, and must transfer to the Rover on arrival, it is impractical that they should be wearing suits designed for suitports, as these are large and bulky. In addition, it would not be practical to have six suitports built into the Rover, and BA 330 modules do not provide suitports.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Mechanical Counter-Pressure spacesuits</h3>

<p>Instead, it’s assumed that MCP (Mechanical Counter-Pressure) suits, also known as SAS’s (Space Activity Suits), will be available in the timeframe of the mission, as these are already reasonably well-advanced and are a field of active research. These are skintight suits, somewhat like SCUBA wetsuits, with a solid helmet and backpack. The backpack, helmet and hard-shell parts of the suit contain life-support, communications, navigation and computing technology.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most advanced MCP suits currently in development are the BioSuits being studied at MIT.</p>

<p>MCP suits offer significant advantages over traditional gas-pressurised spacesuits.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>MCP suits provide considerably better mobility. Gas-pressurised suits are like being in a rigid balloon, and bending any of the joints requires constant force. The gloves are particularly hard to use, and comparable to squeezing a tennis ball. Use of the suits is therefore rather exhausting, and the astronauts cannot work in them for long periods. MCP suits, in comparison, are lighter, less bulky, more flexible, and much easier to move around in.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>MCP suits provide a much higher air pressure. Gas-pressurised suits typically provide very low oxygen pressure in order to maximise mobility as much as possible. However, it’s unhealthy to be exposed to low O2 pressure for extended periods. In addition, it means the astronauts need to spend lengthy periods, sometimes hours, pre-breathing pure O2 to purge N2 from their blood so that they don’t get decompression sickness (a.k.a. “the bends”). BioSuits are currently able to provide up to about 30kPa of pressure, and future versions will be able to provide up to about 35kPa (any higher and mobility begins to be compromised). This is much more healthful for the astronauts. In addition, with an appropriate habitat atmosphere design, it is possible to use the suits without prebreathing. For this reason they are also known as ZPS’s (Zero Prebreathe Spacesuits).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Overall, the use MCP suits means that astronauts will be able to work outside more frequently, for longer periods, more healthfully, while being more comfortable while doing so and capable of doing more useful work. These suits are necessary for Mars missions because they are very long duration (surface mission around 1.5 years) and&nbsp;there is an emphasis on outside work, so hundreds of EVA’s per astronaut may be required.</p>

<p>Please refer to the section on <a href="/air">Air</a> for more information on atmosphere design for the Surface Hab, Rover and marssuits, and how this relates to DCS and ZPS’s.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Airlocks</h2>

<p>Both the Rover and Hab will have an airlock that will permit two people at a time to enter or exit. Most EHA’s and EVA’s will involve two people, so this is a reasonable airlock size considering that we need to optimise for mass and volume. At present we do not have information on airlocks that may already be part of the BA 330 modules. It may be that the airlock will need to be an additional attachment to one end of the module.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Dust mitigation</h3>

<p>One advantage of suitports is that they prevent migration of dust into the vehicle or habitat. When lunar dust migrated into the Apollo Lunar Excursion Modules, the astronauts experienced a number of respiratory issues. Although Martian dust is quite dissimilar to lunar dust, there is a risk that similar problems could occur. One known issue is that Martian dust is high in perchlorates, which causes thyroid dysfunction. There may be additional issues we are not yet aware of. Dust migration into the Hab and Rover must therefore be kept to a bare minimum.</p>

<p>In order to mitigate dust migration into the Surface Hab and Rover, the ceiling and two walls of the airlocks will feature compressed air jets that will blow dust off the suits. The dust will then be sucked through vents in the floor. The air blowing in from the roof and sides and being sucked through the floor will create a downward flow of air, which, in addition to gravity, will carry dust out of the airlock. Depending on the availability of breathable air, the dust and air may simply be blown outside, or, the dust may be blown through a filter and the air reclaimed by the system. The dust filter may then be cleaned or emptied, manually or automatically, at the end of each EVA or as required.</p>

<p>The compressed air jets will be supplemented by two powerful handheld vacuum cleaners with brushes, which the two people in the airlock can use to remove any remaining dust from their own and each other’s suits. After entry from the Martian surface into the airlock, before fully repressurising with breathable air, while air blows downwards through the airlock the two crew members will use the handheld vacuums to clean their own and each other’s suits as meticulously as possible. Once this process has been completed to both astronauts’ satisfaction, they press a button, suction through the floor vents will cease, and the air will continue to be pumped into the airlock from the compressed air jets until it’s fully pressurised with breathable air.</p>

<h3>Suit storage and recharging bay</h3>

<p>Inside the Hab will be racks to hang up to six marssuits. A number of spare suits will be transported to Mars with the Hab, along with replacement parts and patch kits. In addition, the computer will store models of all spare parts for suits that can be printed by the 3D printer.</p>

<p>The suits will be powered by rechargeable battery packs, most likely Li-ion or graphene supercapacitors. In the area in the Hab where the suits are stored, and also in the Rover, there will be charging sockets where the suits’ battery packs can be recharged from the Hab or Rover’s power system.</p>
