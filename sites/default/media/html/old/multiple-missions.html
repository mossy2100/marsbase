<p>The DRA specifies a program of three missions for these reasons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<p>A more substantial overall return on the necessary investment in hardware development, human resources and intellectual capital can be achieved if the mission architecture is implemented a minimum of three times.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>To complete the DRA three times, using successive launch opportunities, will take a total of approximately one decade. During this period of time new technology will become available, the space industry will have evolved, and it will probably be appropriate timing to develop a more efficient or practical architecture.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>This reasoning apply equally well to Blue Dragon, and hence three missions should be considered the <em>minimum</em> number; however, the intention is to run many missions to the International Mars Research Station, of the order of 10 to 100, as has been done with the ISS and the MARSâ€™s. The goal is to establish a permanent human presence on Mars and a base for further exploration. 75 missions have been run to the ISS and more than 150 to the Mars Analog Research Stations. Over the coming decades, as the technology develops (in particular reusable rockets), the goal is that cost of a human mission to Mars will become affordable enough that missions to the IMRS can be run almost as frequently as they are to the ISS today.</p>

<p>After each run-through of the architecture, opportunities to make improvements will present themselves and each mission will be progressively more efficient, faster, cheaper, safer, or otherwise an incremental improvement on the previous. The first mission will require the bulk of the expenditure, after which it will decrease as the architecture, designs and hardware components are re-used and improved.</p>

<p>Re-use of the architecture multiple times produces an even greater value benefit in Blue Dragon than it does in DRA, because the missions are all targeted at the same location, therefore, much of the hardware delivered in the initial pre-deployment can be re-used by each successive mission. If an ongoing financial commitment can be secured from each space agency in the partnership, this would enable the subsequent development of an updated architecture based on new technology and scientific information, and further exploration and development of Mars could continue.</p>
