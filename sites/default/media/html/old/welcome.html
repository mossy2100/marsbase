<p>Welcome to the <strong>International Mars Research Station</strong>, a plan to bring the world’s leading space-faring nations together to cooperate in the establishment of a permanent human presence on Mars.</p>

<p>This website presents a program of near-term, affordable and achievable missions to send international crews of six people to Mars and return them safely to Earth, while developing a base on Mars as an initial step towards settlement. The concept for the base is the <em>International Mars Research Station</em> (IMRS), a shared facility to be developed by a partnership comprised of the world’s top space agencies, for use by <em>all</em> nations and peoples.</p>

<p>This plan is supported by a modern, practical, safe and affordable architecture for human Mars missions called “Blue Dragon”, which takes advantage of the latest advancements in space technology. Blue Dragon is an evolution of the <a href="/nasa-design-reference-architecture">NASA Design Reference Architecture 5.0</a> [DRAKE2], incorporating several innovations designed to reduce costs and to maximise safety, the likelihood of success, and the overall benefit to humanity.</p>

<p>The main difference between Blue Dragon ans the DRA is the choice to focus on a single location rather than several, thus enabling reuse of base components across multiple missions. Additional advantages are gained through the use of reusable rockets and reusable interplanetary spacecraft. Commercial off-the-shelf hardware components, such as capsules, rockets, spacesuits and habitat modules, are utilised as much as possible in order to further reduce expenses by saving on development costs. ISRU (In Situ Resource Utilisation) technology is used for manufacturing propellant, breathable air and water, thereby reducing launch mass and mission cost. Controlling program cost will reduce obstacles to sending humans to Mars, making it possible to achieve that goal sooner, and will enable more missions to be conducted and more countries to be involved, thus benefiting more people.</p>

<p>The architecture achieves improved safety by using capsules to ferry crews between the surfaces and orbits of Earth and Mars; pre-deploying virtually all the base hardware, including the Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV), Surface Habitat, surface vehicles (rovers), power systems and ISRU equipment; and providing redundant backup elements of the base, such as a spare habitat, rover, solar panels, etc.</p>

<p>IMRS and the Blue Dragon architecture have been designed as a first step in a broader process of settlement rather than a standalone Apollo-style “flags and footprints” program focused purely on science and/or exploration. This affects the destination of the mission as well as surface activities. The reasoning is that science and exploration can proceed more easily and rapidly once a permanent human presence has been established, and since we plan to settle Mars eventually anyway, it&#39;s more efficient to take that approach from the start. Research activities during surface missions will be oriented around science and exploration, but also engineering and construction, primarily in the context of supporting human habitation and settlement of Mars.</p>

<p>The plan outlined here is not designed to serve the interests of any one nation, but humanity as a whole. For this reason, and also due to the cost and scale of the IMRS program, the intention is that it will be completed by an international consortium of space agencies, and perhaps also companies and universities, rather than a single entity. This is considered necessary for budgetary as well as political, ethical and philosophical reasons.</p>

<p>It is hoped that you will enjoy learning more about this exciting project, which has the potential to bring the world together in a peaceful and tremendously historic adventure, namely, opening up a new world for human civilisation. It’s important to note that this website currently serves purely a means of presenting and sharing this idea, and at the time of writing no space agencies are attached to it as yet. If and when this changes, the site will be updated to reflect that. Part of the reason for building this website is to present the idea and hopefully to engage the interest of space-faring nations and companies.</p>
