<p>The IMRS plan includes a new humans-to-Mars mission architecture that exploits some of the latest
  developments in space technology such as reusable rockets, capsules that can land on solid ground,
  inflatable space habitats and mechanical counter-pressure spacesuits. It is modern, practical,
  comparatively safer than its predecessors, and affordable. Although designed for multiple missions
  to a single location, which is the plan for IMRS, it would also be practical for missions to
  discrete locations.</p>

<p>In this document the architecture is described mostly in relation to high-level design choices
  without going into deep engineering detail.</p>

<p>The name of the architecture, “Blue Dragon”, was inspired by “Red Dragon”, the Mars landing
  system adapted from SpaceX Dragon capsules, as these capsules, which have the potential to safely
  and accurately land cargo and crews on Mars, provide the fundamental point of difference that
  enables improvements over the DRA. The architecture connects Mars and Earth; Mars is red, Earth is
  blue. Also, the dragon in the SpaceX Dragon logo is blue.</p>

<p>Blue Dragon is an evolution of the NASA Human Exploration of Mars - Design Reference Architecture
  (DRA) 5.0 (ed. Drake 2009). The DRA is arguably the most mature Mars mission architecture
  currently available, having been iteratively developed by hundreds of qualified people since 1995.
  Nonetheless, it has the potential to be further improved on the basis of new science, technology
  and ideas. The changes presented here improve safety, reduce cost, and achieve a superior overall
  result.</p>

<p>The IMRS program does not have precisely the same goals as the DRA, although they are very
  similar.</p>

<p>The DRA proposes a series of three more-or-less identical missions to Mars, each to different,
  scientifically interesting locations, and at these locations to perform exploration and scientific
  research of Mars; for example, analysing rocks, dust, subsurface ice and the Martian atmosphere,
  searching for past or extant life, and so on. In addition, the DRA program proposes to research
  ISRU technologies, including production of oxygen, water and food, and strategies for long-term
  habitation of Mars.</p>

<p>The DRA is like “Apollo on Mars”, in the sense that each mission in the Apollo program went to a
  different location on the Moon. Although the scientific research performed at the Apollo sites has
  been useful for investigation into future settlement of the Moon, none of the Apollo sites were
  considered as locations of future settlements, because settlement was not the main focus. Although
  it was hoped by many that Apollo would continue into the Apollo Applications Program and that a
  permanent human presence would be established on the Moon, for various reasons this never
  eventuated, and at that time the private sector was not in a position to undertake such a
  challenge itself.</p>

<p>In the 45 years since Apollo 11 there has been considerable ongoing interest in establishing a
  lunar settlement, with the Artemis Society and their associated public outreach group the Moon
  Society being major proponents, along with other enthusiast groups and major space agencies.
  However, as robotic exploration of Mars has progressed and understanding of the red planet has
  developed, it’s apparent that a much stronger desire has emerged in the space community for
  settlement of Mars. Despite the emergence of companies such as Moon Express and Golden Spike,
  private missions such as Inspiration Mars and Mars One are receiving much more attention, as are
  the Mars settlement plans of companies like SpaceX and Virgin Galactic.</p>

<p>If membership in space enthusiast groups and public interest in missions are any kind of
  indicators, the number of people supportive of colonisation of Mars far outweighs that of Earth
  orbit or the Moon. Because of Mars’s similarities with Earth, such as a day length of
  approximately 24 hours, seasons, weather, a transparent atmosphere, a coloured sky, and
  familiar-looking terrain highly reminiscent of Earthian deserts, settlement of Mars is far more
  amenable to the human imagination and therefore has greater appeal. Its abundance of all the
  elements necessary for life and technological civilisation, including a range of options for
  energy production, make it a far more attractive and accessible settlement target than any
  alternative.</p>

<p>As humanity’s technical capability develops, interest in settlement of Mars grows steadily. The
  facts that over 200,000 people applied for a one-way trip to Mars as part of the Mars One
  initiative, plus the consistent turnout to various international Mars conferences by enthusiasts
  and industry leaders, are strong indicators of this trend.</p>

<p>Inspiration Mars and Mars One represent the first two of what is likely to be an ongoing series
  of proposed missions to Mars initiated by private enterprise. These missions have developed from a
  growing interest in settlement of Mars, and have stimulated yet more interest. More missions will
  surely follow, both public and private, stimulated by advancements in computing, robotics,
  materials, space hardware, other branches of science, technology and engineering, and the ongoing
  evolution of the space economy.</p>

<h4>Naming</h4>

<p>The first mission to the IMRS is called “Alfa Mission” and the first crew is called “Alfa Crew”;
  the second mission is called “Bravo Mission” and the second crew is named “Bravo Crew”; and so on,
  following the International Radiotelephony Spelling Alphabet. This pattern has been adopted to
  support clear radio communications between different Mars exploration crews and Earth, which will
  become increasingly important when multiple missions are underway at the same time.</p>

<p>In order to mitigate acronym overload, friendly names, or at least, more memorable acronyms, are
  used for some of the components.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The MTV is a spaceship, and ships, generally speaking, should have a more interesting name
    than “MTV”. The first MTV is therefore named “Adeona”, the Roman goddess of safe return. The
    name comes from the Latin verb <i>adeo</i>, which means to approach, go to, visit, attend,
    undertake or undergo, as well as to take possession of one’s inheritance. This is appropriate,
    as Mars is humanity’s inheritance, and a safe return is desired for the crew.
  </li>
  <li>The crew capsules are named after famous scientists. The name of the specialised Dragon
    capsule that carries the crew from the surface of Earth to Earth orbit, then from Mars orbit to
    the surface of Mars, is called “Einstein”. This name came from Earth-Mars Capsule, or EMC, which
    is reminiscent of Albert Einstein’s famous equation e=mc<sup>2</sup>. The Mars Ascent Capsule is
    named “Kepler” after Johannes Kepler, due to his associated with Mars and orbital mechanics, and
    the Earth Descent Capsule is named “Newton” after Isaac Newton, due to his associated with
    gravity. (All of these were male Europeans, but please don’t be offended if you aren’t male or
    European — the names are just for the purpose of this document!)
  </li>
  <li>The pressurised rover is known as the Crewed Adaptable Multipurpose Pressurised Exploration
    Rover, or “CAMPER”, which alludes to the vehicle’s form and function. The robot that collects
    water from the Martian surface is called “AWESOM”, which stands for “Autonomous Water Extraction
    from the Surface Of Mars”.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Spacecraft names are shown in italics, as per the convention for aquatic ships.</p>

<h2><a id="section3-2"></a>3.2. Mission Overview</h2>

<p>The following schedule gives an overview of the proposed first human mission to Mars. Subsequent
  missions can utilise substantially the same architecture, except predeploying different assets
  depending on the needs of the base.</p>

<h4>Phase 1: Prepare (now-2030)</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Improve TRL of the Red Dragon technology, marssuits, B330 habitat modules, and other hardware
    elements.
  </li>
  <li>Develop and construct the SHAB, THAB, MAV, CAMPER, satellites, methalox rocket engines,
    propellant pods and other major hardware components.
  </li>
  <li>Select location for the IMRS.</li>
  <li>Select and train Alfa Crew.</li>
  <li>Conduct precursor missions.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Phase 2: Predeployment (2031)</h4>

<p>As the intention is to send the crew in 2033, the predeployment phase is scheduled for the launch
  opportunity prior, in 2031.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/sites/default/media/images/bat-chart-1-predeploy.png" alt="Bat chart - Predeployment"/>
  <figcaption>Bat chart - Predeployment</figcaption>
</figure>

<ol>
  <li>Launch the MAV, SHAB and CAMPER, land them safely at IMRS, remotely activate and test.
    Commence ISRU operations.
  </li>
  <li>Pack and launch the Mars Supply Capsules, and send to the IMRS.</li>
  <li>Launch first MCOS and place in areostationary orbit above IMRS.</li>
  <li>Launch first HLCRS and place in heliocentric orbit.</li>
  <li>Use the CAMPER to explore the surrounding terrain and find a suitable LZ (Landing Zone) for
    <i>Einstein</i>.
  </li>
</ol>

<h4>Phase 3: Construct <i>Adeona</i> (~2032)</h4>

<p>Although the construction of <i>Adeona</i> is scheduled here for 2032, it could be done at almost
  any time before the 2033 launch. The sooner <i>Adeona</i> is built, the sooner she can be used for
  training missions.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/sites/default/media/images/bat-chart-2-MTV-construct.png"
    alt="Bat chart - MTV construction"/>
  <figcaption>Bat chart - MTV construction</figcaption>
</figure>

<ol>
  <li>On Earth, inflate and fit out the THAB, and pack with supplies. Run training missions on the
    ground.
  </li>
  <li>Construct the two halves of <i>Adeona</i>, and launch to LEO using SLS 105t Cargo rockets.
  </li>
  <li>Assemble <i>Adeona</i> on orbit by connecting the two halves together.
  </li>
  <li>Run training missions to <i>Adeona</i>.</li>
  <li>Launch 10 reusable Falcon Heavies with full methalox propellant pods to <i>Adeona</i>.
  </li>
</ol>

<h4>Phase 4: Crew Outbound (2033)</h4>

<figure>
  <img src="/sites/default/media/images/bat-chart-3-outbound.png"
    alt="Bat chart - crew outbound phase"/>
  <figcaption>Bat chart - crew outbound phase</figcaption>
</figure>

<ol>
  <li>Launch the crew to LEO in <i>Einstein</i> atop a Falcon 9.</li>
  <li><i>Einstein</i> performs EOR (Earth Orbit Rendezvous) with <i>Adeona,</i> and crew transfers
    into the THAB.
  </li>
  <li>With <i>Einstein</i> still docked, <i>Adeona</i> climbs from LEO to HEEO (Highly Elliptical
    Earth Orbit) in a series of six increasingly elliptical orbits, jettisoning one propellant pod
    after each burn to reduce mass.
  </li>
  <li><i>Adeona</i> performs the TMI (Trans-Mars Injection) burn and flies to Mars on a Hohmann MTO
    (Mars Transfer Orbit) for ~6 months.
  </li>
  <li>Immediately prior to MOI, any unrecyclable waste generated during the outbound trip is
    jettisoned to reduce mass.
  </li>
  <li><i>Adeona</i> performs MOI (Mars Orbit Insertion) and parks on HEMO (Highly Elliptical Mars
    Orbit).
  </li>
  <li>The 7<sup>th</sup> empty propellant pod is jettisoned to reduce mass.</li>
  <li>The crew prebreathe and don their marssuits in preparation for Mars descent. <i>Adeona</i> is
    placed in standby mode.
  </li>
  <li>The crew transfers from the THAB back into <i>Einstein</i>, and descend to the surface of
    Mars.
  </li>
  <li>Under remote control by the crew, the CAMPER is driven from the SHAB to <i>Einstein</i>’s LZ.
  </li>
  <li>The crew exit <i>Einstein</i> and step onto the surface of Mars. They enter the CAMPER through
    its airlock, two at a time.
  </li>
  <li>The crew drives the CAMPER to the SHAB.</li>
  <li>The crew exit the CAMPER through its airlock, and enter the SHAB through its airlock, two at a
    time.
  </li>
</ol>

<h4>Phase 4: Surface Mission (2033-2035)</h4>

<ol>
  <li>The crew spend 1-2 weeks in the SHAB, setting up their living space, testing systems, and
    adapting to Mars gravity and the SHAB’s atmosphere.
  </li>
  <li>The surface mission proceeds for ~18 months. During this time, the AWESOM robot, PV blanket
    and ISPP modules are moved from the MAV to the SHAB.
  </li>
</ol>

<h4>Phase 5: Crew Return (2035)</h4>

<figure>
  <img src="/sites/default/media/images/bat-chart-4-return.png"
    alt="Bat chart - crew return phase"/>
  <figcaption>Bat chart - crew return phase</figcaption>
</figure>

<ol>
  <li>A full systems check is performed on the MAV and <i>Adeona</i>.</li>
  <li>All samples for Earth return are stowed in <i>Kepler</i>.</li>
  <li>The SHAB is cleaned and tidied, and placed in standby mode in preparation for arrival of the
    next crew in ~8 months.
  </li>
  <li>The crew transfers to the CAMPER wearing marssuits, drive the CAMPER to the MAV, then transfer
    to <i>Kepler</i>.
  </li>
  <li>The CAMPER is remotely driven back to the SHAB so it won’t be damaged by the launch of the
    MAV.
  </li>
  <li>The MAV, with crew, launches from Mars surface.</li>
  <li>On approach to <i>Adeona</i>’s orbit, <i>Kepler</i> separates from the main body of the MAV,
    which is discarded. It will circle Mars for a while before falling back to the surface; or it
    could remain on orbit for future reuse.
  </li>
  <li><i>Kepler</i> performs MOR (Mars Orbit Rendezvous) with <i>Adeona</i>, and the crew transfers
    the samples and themselves to the THAB.
  </li>
  <li><i>Kepler</i> is undocked and left on Mars orbit for future recovery and reuse.
  </li>
  <li>Any surplus contingency food and water is jettisoned to reduce mass.</li>
  <li><i>Adeona</i> performs TEI (Trans-Earth Injection) and flies back to Earth on a minimum-energy
    Hohmann MTO for ~6 months.
  </li>
  <li>The 8<sup>th</sup> empty propellant pod is jettisoned to reduce mass.</li>
  <li><i>Adeona</i> performs EOI (Earth Orbit Insertion) to reach HEEO.</li>
  <li>The 9<sup>th</sup> empty propellant pod is jettisoned to reduce mass.</li>
  <li><i>Adeona</i> performs an orbital transfer burn to return to LEO.</li>
  <li>A Falcon 9 with <i>Newton</i> is launched from Earth.</li>
  <li><i>Newton</i> performs EOR with <i>Adeona</i>.</li>
  <li>The crew transfers themselves and their samples from the THAB to <i>Newton</i>.
  </li>
  <li><i>Newton</i> undocks and performs EDL to Earth surface.</li>
  <li>The crew and samples are quarantined.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Phase 6: Recover/Prepare</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Alfa Crew is debriefed, and commence physical rehabilitation to restore fitness.
  </li>
  <li>Charlie Crew is selected and trained. (Bravo Crew will have departed for Mars in the second
    MTV about 4 months prior to Alfa Crew’s return.)
  </li>
  <li>Missions are conducted to refurbish and refill <i>Adeona</i> with propellant in preparation
    for Charlie Mission in 22 months.
  </li>
  <li>Additional hardware and supplies sent to the IMRS, such as solar panels, greenhouse modules,
    replacement parts, etc.
  </li>
</ol>
